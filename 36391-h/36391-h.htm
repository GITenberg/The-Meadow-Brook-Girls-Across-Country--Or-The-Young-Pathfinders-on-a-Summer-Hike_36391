<h2><a name='chI' id='chI'></a>CHAPTER I—A NIGHT OF EXCITEMENT</h2>
<p>
“Oh, where can Crazy Jane be!” wailed
Margery Brown.
</p>
<p>
“It isn’t so much a question of
where Jane may be as where we ourselves are,
Buster,” answered Harriet Burrell, laughingly.
“However, if she doesn’t come, why, we
will make the best of it. This will not be the
first time we have spent the night out of doors.”
</p>
<p>
“Are we lost?” gasped Hazel Holland.
</p>
<p>
“It looks very much as though we had gone
astray,” replied Miss Elting, who was acting as
guardian and chaperon to the Meadow-Brook
Girls.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, thave me!” wailed Grace Thompson,
her impish little face appearing to grow several
degrees smaller.
</p>
<p>
“Girls! Please do not become excited,”
urged the guardian. “There is no cause for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8'></a>8</span>
alarm. Even if we have lost our way we shall
find it again on the morrow. Harriet, you have
the map. Suppose we examine it again and see
if we can find out where we are. We surely
must be near human habitation, and the country
is so open that really getting lost is quite
impossible.”
</p>
<p>
Harriet Burrell unslung the pack that she
carried over her shoulder, then felt about in it
until she found that for which she was looking.
She spread the map out on the ground at
one side of the road, her companions gathering
about and gazing down over her shoulder.
Miss Elting sat down beside the map.
</p>
<p>
“Here! Trace our day’s route with the pencil,”
she said. “This should be Harmon’s Valley.
That being the case, the village of Harmon
should be not more than a mile farther on.”
</p>
<p>
“There is no village anywhere near us, according
to the route we have traveled since this
morning,” answered Harriet.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, that can’t be possible,” exclaimed Miss
Elting.
</p>
<p>
“Please look for yourself, Miss Elting,” Harriet
replied earnestly. “After leaving Granite
Mountain we swung to the left as you will see
by the line I have marked.”
</p>
<p>
“Hm-m-m,” murmured the guardian as she
scanned the map.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span>
</p>
<p>
“It looks to me very much as though we had
taken the wrong valley,” said Harriet, as she
paused in her scrutiny of the map to glance up
at the hills that shut in the valley where they
now were. “See! There isn’t a town marked
on this map anywhere in this valley.”
</p>
<p>
“I believe you are right. In order to get to
our stopping place for the night we shall have
to cross those hills to the right. How far is it
across?”
</p>
<p>
“Five miles,” answered Harriet, after making
some brief measurements.
</p>
<p>
“Five mileth?” wailed Grace. “Oh, thave
me!”
</p>
<p>
“Tommy, will you be quiet?” begged Margery.
“You make me nervous. Miss Elting,
you aren’t going on, to-night, are you? I simply
can’t walk another mile. My feet are so
numb that I can’t feel them.”
</p>
<p>
“I can feel mine. They are ath big ath
elephantth,” declared Tommy.
</p>
<p>
“What do you say, girls? Shall we go on
or make camp for the night?” questioned the
guardian. “Remember, Jane McCarthy is no
doubt waiting with her car for us over in the
other valley. She will not know where to go if
we do not get in touch with her to-night.”
</p>
<p>
Grace, Hazel and Margery begged Miss Elting
to go no farther. They already had made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span>
ten miles that day, which they declared was
quite enough.
</p>
<p>
“What do you say, Harriet?” asked Miss
Elting.
</p>
<p>
“Of course I am a little footsore, but I could
walk another ten miles if necessary. However,
the other girls do not wish to go farther, so I
vote with them to remain here for the night.
But won’t Jane be puzzled where to go in the
morning!”
</p>
<p>
“She will find us, my dear,” smiled the
guardian.
</p>
<p>
“If you think best I will cross the ridge, after
supper, and see if I can find her,” suggested
Harriet Burrell.
</p>
<p>
“No. I could not think of permitting you
to do that, Harriet. Jane will be sure to wait
at the meeting place we agreed upon until noon
to-morrow before starting on to the next stopping
place.”
</p>
<p>
“But we haven’t any plathe to thleep,” protested
the lisping Tommy. “I can’t thleep on
the ground, can I?”
</p>
<p>
“No. You are going to sleep standing up
like a horse,” answered Margery petulantly.
</p>
<p>
“No, I’m not. I’m going to lie down jutht
like I alwayth do,” lisped the little girl.
</p>
<p>
“Girls, stop your disputing. We have other
things to think of,” rebuked Harriet. “Let’s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span>
try to make the best of our unpleasant situation.”
</p>
<p>
Miss Elting, shading her eyes with her hand,
gazed inquiringly at the surrounding country.
It was barren of buildings except for a large
barn and a number of stacks and sheds, some
distance away in a field to the west. Still beyond
this was a clump of trees and bushes.
There was nothing else—no house, no human
beings other than themselves in sight.
</p>
<p>
“Girls, let’s investigate that miniature forest
over yonder,” called the guardian. “It
looks as though it might be an excellent place in
which to cook supper, provided we are able to
find water.”
</p>
<p>
“Supper!” cried the girls in chorus. They
realized all at once that they were hungry.
With one accord they snatched up their packs,
heavy as they were, slung them over their
shoulders and laboriously climbed the roadside
fence. Tommy caught her foot on the top rail
in attempting to jump to the ground on the other
side.
</p>
<p>
“Look out!” warned Miss Elting sharply.
</p>
<p>
“Thave me!” wailed the lisping Tommy and
sprawled on all fours on the other side of the
fence, kicking frantically as she fell.
</p>
<p>
“Are you hurt, dear?” cried Harriet, springing
over to her companion.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span>
</p>
<p>
“Hurt? I gueth I am. Don’t you thee, I’ve
thkinned my nothe. Oh, I withh I were home!”
</p>
<p>
“No, you don’t. Think what a lot of fun you
are having,” comforted Harriet. “There!
You are all right now.”
</p>
<p>
“Am I all right?”
</p>
<p>
“Of course you are.”
</p>
<p>
“All right, if you thay tho,” nodded Tommy,
gathering up her pack and moving away with
Harriet Burrell’s arm about her. Miss Elting
and the other girls had started for the clump
of trees. Arriving, they quickly flung down
their packs. The guardian began hunting for
water. She found a stream of cold water just
inside the clump of trees beyond the field, as she
had anticipated. The greenness of the foliage
about the spot had told her that water was near.
In other parts of the valley the leaves were
turning. There was a strong suggestion of Autumn
in the air, which at night was crisp and
bracing, though the days thus far on their long
tramp, had been unusually warm for so late in
the Fall.
</p>
<p>
It was Harriet’s duty to build the fire. She
went about this task at once. There was some
difficulty in finding wood that would burn.
After searching she found some pieces of old
fence rails. These were of pine, and as they
were too long for a fire over which to cook food,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>
Harriet got out her hatchet and began to chop
them into smaller pieces. It was a hard task to
chop through a rail, sharp though the hatchet
was. However, within fifteen minutes, the girl
had accomplished the task and the fire was
burning.
</p>
<p>
“I am afraid I can’t promise a great variety
or quantity of edibles for supper,” announced
Miss Elting, “though what there is to eat will
be appetizing.”
</p>
<p>
“If there is enough, it will answer,” Margery
declared.
</p>
<p>
“Enough?” repeated Tommy wisely. “Buthter,
you thurely ought to diet—a girl ath thtout
ath you are.”
</p>
<p>
“I think I’ve heard you remark something
of the sort before,” sighed Margery wearily.
“I wish you would forget that I weigh—well,
never mind how much! The subject is a distressing
one. I’m almost too hungry to-night
to think of anything except eating.”
</p>
<p>
Tommy’s mischievous glance roved about,
resting first on Harriet, who with flushed face
was bending over the fire, then on Miss Elting,
who was slicing bacon. In addition to the
bacon there was to be coffee, supplemented by
a few biscuits. There was nothing very hearty
about that repast for healthy girls who had
tramped for hours under a warm September
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>
sun. Still, there were no complaints, save as
Tommy and Margery had voiced their disgust
with their present life.
</p>
<p>
Though none of these young women could
guess it, they were destined, before morning,
to encounter enough excitement to make them
all wish they had never started on this long
walk from Camp Wau-Wau, where they had
spent the summer, to their homes in Meadow-Brook.
</p>
<p>
Surely the Meadow-Brook Girls need no introduction
to the readers of this series who
will recall how, under the chaperonage of Miss
Elting, the four girls had gone to the summer
camp in the Pocono Woods, where, somehow,
each day of their life had grown increasingly
exciting. All of the things that happened to
Harriet and her friends at that time are set
forth in the first volume of this series, under
the title of “<span class='sc'>The Meadow-Brook Girls Under
Canvas</span>.” While in the summer camp the
Meadow-Brook Girls had passed through many
varied and exciting experiences. The mischievous
initiation of Harriet Burrell and Grace
Thompson by the older girls, the arrival in the
camp of Jane McCarthy, known to her friends
as “Crazy Jane” and the series of lively happenings
that followed her coming; the nocturnal
visit of a bear, and Harriet’s spirited chase of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>
the animal were incidents that contributed to
the interest of the narrative.
</p>
<p>
Harriet’s brave rescue of her companions
during a severe storm and her subsequent generous
treatment of the two Camp Girls, Patricia
Scott and Cora Kidder, who had plotted against
her, won for her the warm admiration of her associates
at Camp Wau-Wau.
</p>
<p>
When it had come time to leave the camp in
the great forest it had been agreed by the
Meadow-Brook Girls and their guardian that,
instead of returning by train they would walk
all the way home, disdaining any “lifts” or
other helps that prevented them from making
their way strictly on foot.
</p>
<p>
So endeared had “Crazy Jane” McCarthy
become to them all during her stay in camp
that she had been voted as one of their number.
Crazy Jane, however, would hear of but
little walking. She sent for her automobile, a
present from her father, and insisted on using
this in “scouting” and in carrying the tent and
provisions for the Pathfinders, as the Meadow-Brook
Girls now elected to call themselves.
</p>
<p>
Each night Jane would meet the girls at a
place agreed upon in advance. Then the tent
would be pitched at some distance from the
highway, and there the girls would spend the
night. But now, on the third day, the Meadow-Brook
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>
Girls had failed to meet their supply car.
What they were to do for the night, Miss Elting
did not know. Her first move was to see to the
preparation of the little food that they had with
them.
</p>
<p>
Jane McCarthy, with a full purse and a
wealthy, indulgent father, had claimed the right
of being purveyor of food on that long journey.
The speed at which that young woman traveled
permitted of her foraging far and wide. Whereever
she went she was likely to be remembered,
for it was her reckless driving that had given
her the name of “Crazy Jane.” Yet this light-hearted,
impulsive girl had wonderful control
of her machine. With all her reckless driving
she had never yet injured any one, though her
friends often remonstrated with her for her haphazard
style of running her car.
</p>
<p>
Supper finished, Margery and Hazel were
left to attend to the dishes, and to put them
in the packs, which were ordinary hunters’ bags,
made to strap over the shoulders.
</p>
<p>
“After you have finished the work, girls,”
directed Miss Elting, “be sure to extinguish the
last spark of the fire. Harriet, will you come
with me?”
</p>
<p>
“Thay, where are you going?” cried Grace.
“Pleathe don’t go away and leave uth here
alone. It ith going to be dark, pretty thoon.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you want a place to sleep?” smiled
the guardian.
</p>
<p>
“Yeth, but it’th getting dark,” Tommy insisted.
</p>
<p>
“All the more reason for finding sleeping
quarters,” smiled Miss Elting.
</p>
<p>
“Are you thinking of trying the barns?”
asked Harriet, as she and the guardian stepped
away.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. I don’t see anything else to do.”
</p>
<p>
“We’re going to have a storm,” Harriet
went on thoughtfully, “so of course we shall do
well to secure more shelter than we could get
by making a brush lean-to.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t believe we are in the least danger
of being disturbed in the barn,” the guardian
continued. “I don’t imagine there are any
other human beings within several miles of this
place. This is certainly a very lonesome bit of
country. It is the first day since we have been
out that we haven’t met some one. That may
be because we have kept away from the roads
to-day. We haven’t been on a highway more
than an hour all day long.”
</p>
<p>
“This is what I like,” answered Harriet. “I
just love to strike out across country and blaze
new trails. It’s ever so much more interesting.
But, Miss Elting, are you certain there is no
one about?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>
</p>
<p>
The guardian halted sharply and faced her
companion. She knew Harriet Burrell too well
not to understand that the girl’s question was
significant.
</p>
<p>
“What is it?” she asked.
</p>
<p>
“I saw some one not far from camp when
we were eating our supper,” was Harriet’s
quiet announcement.
</p>
<p>
“You are sure of that?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes; it was just beyond the woods there.
At first I thought it a fence post; then all at
once the post moved. I saw it was a person.”
</p>
<p>
“What was the person doing, Harriet?”
</p>
<p>
“The person appeared to be watching us. I
also discovered something else. The person
was a <em>woman</em>.”
</p>
<p>
Miss Elting threw back her head and laughed
merrily.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t think we need to be very much
alarmed at that. So long as it wasn’t a tramp
you saw, we won’t disturb ourselves.”
</p>
<p>
“She was a strange looking creature,” continued
Harriet. “I couldn’t make her out very
well. All at once she disappeared in the most
mysterious fashion. You said something. I
glanced up, then back to the place where the
woman had been standing and she had gone.
It happened in less than half a dozen seconds.
She would have to be a pretty lively person to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>
get out of sight in that time, wouldn’t she, Miss
Elting?”
</p>
<p>
The guardian nodded. They had now reached
the big barn. Like its surroundings, it was deserted
so far as they were able to observe.
Miss Elting wished to examine the place while
there was still light, so they hurried in, the
doors being wide open. The scent of hay was
strong on the air as they entered. There were
little heaps of hay on the barn floor, and on
either side in the mows the hay was piled up
high. Ladders led up to the top of the mows
from the barn floor.
</p>
<p>
“This looks nice and comfy, doesn’t it?”
smiled the guardian.
</p>
<p>
“The best sort of bedroom,” agreed Harriet.
“I hope there are no mice here?”
</p>
<p>
“Mice? Gracious! I hope not, too. I think
we can do no better than to climb the ladder
to the top of one of the mows, roll up in our
blankets and go to sleep. Which bedroom will
you take, the north or the south?”
</p>
<p>
“I think I should prefer the room on the
south side. One is more likely to get the morning
sun there,” answered Harriet gravely.
</p>
<p>
Miss Elting laughed.
</p>
<p>
“Thank you. I hadn’t thought of it in that
light. The south side bedroom will be best for
the Meadow-Brook Girls. I know Jane McCarthy would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span>
enjoy this sort of camping out.
As it is, she will have to sleep at a farm house
to-night. She will never be able to find us here.
Suppose you climb the ladder and see how the
land lies.”
</p>
<p>
“You mean the hay,” chuckled Harriet, running
up the ladder with agility. “Oh, it is fine
up here, and just as warm as can be. Won’t
it be splendid to sleep on the hay?” she called
down, peering over the edge of the mow.
</p>
<p>
After gazing over the mows for some moments
Harriet finally descended to the floor.
Next she and Miss Elting made a survey of the
yard back of the barn. The yard was surrounded
by empty sheds and great stacks of hay
and straw. It was evident that the owners intended
to winter considerable stock in this remote
place.
</p>
<p>
“Well, what do you think of it, Harriet?”
inquired Miss Elting.
</p>
<p>
“Glorious! It is as clean and sweet here as
in our own bedrooms at home. I’ll tell you
what I will do. I’ll run back and get the girls,”
said Harriet.
</p>
<p>
Miss Elting nodded acquiescence and Harriet
hurried across the field, the teacher remaining
at the barn to investigate the place further
while Harriet went for her companions. This
she did, and decided that they were most fortunate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>
in finding so comfortable a place in
which to spend the night.
</p>
<p>
Half an hour later she heard them coming.
Tommy’s chatter sounded louder than the conversation
of all the rest of the party. Twilight
had settled over the interior of the barn by the
time the girls came trooping in.
</p>
<p>
“Br-r-r-r! This place looks spooky,” cried
Margery. “We aren’t going to stay in here all
night, are we, Miss Elting?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, Margery. You are not afraid of the
dark, are you?”
</p>
<p>
“No-o-o. But——”
</p>
<p>
“There is nothing to alarm you. As we are
all rather tired, I propose that we go upstairs
and get to bed at once. I am sorry we shall
not be able to get our baths this evening. This
hotel isn’t provided with bath tubs. By the
way. There are matches in our packs, so we
will leave them below. One of the first things
a Camp Girl learns, you know, is to be careful
of fire both indoors and out. Strap your
blanket rolls over your shoulders. You know
it is quite a climb to your bedrooms.”
</p>
<p>
“Up there is where we sleep,” Harriet informed
them. The top of the mow was not discernible
from the barn floor now.
</p>
<p>
“What! Away up there?” demanded Margery.
“How do we get up?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span>
</p>
<p>
“We shall have to climb the ladder,” answered
Miss Elting.
</p>
<p>
Margery groaned.
</p>
<p>
“I’m glad it’s dark. If it were daylight I
know I should fall,” declared Hazel. “Let me
go first. I don’t want to stand here and think
about what is before me. If I stop to think I’ll
never have the courage to climb.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t look down,” cautioned the guardian.
“There. That’s fine.”
</p>
<p>
Hazel was going up rapidly. Margery, with
many a groan, next essayed the climb. Harriet
was directly behind her. Margery had not gone
far before the wisdom of Harriet’s action became
apparent. A wail from Margery brought
a chorus of “ohs!” from her companions.
</p>
<p>
“I can’t go another step,” gasped Margery.
“I’m going to fall. Catch me somebody.”
</p>
<p>
“Margery, keep on climbing. I’m right below
you here. Go on,” urged Harriet.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I—I can’t. I’m dizzy.”
</p>
<p>
“Buthter ith theathick,” observed Tommy
from the barn floor. Harriet began lightly,
tapping Buster with a switch that she had
brought with her.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! Ouch! Stop it! I tell you stop it!”
howled Margery.
</p>
<p>
“Climb!”
</p>
<p>
Margery <em>did</em> climb. She went up the ladder
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>
faster than she ever had climbed before, wailing
and threatening every foot of the way.
Tommy was delightedly dancing about on the
barn floor during all this time, uttering a perfect
volley of unintelligible lisps and jeering
cries. Margery reached the top of the ladder
and flung herself panting on the hay.
</p>
<p>
“Be careful not to come too near the edge,”
warned Harriet, hurriedly clambering down.
Buster made no reply. She was too much out
of breath to say a word. “Now, let’s see what
<em>you</em> can do, Tommy. See if you can do any
better,” chuckled Harriet.
</p>
<p>
“You jutht thee me climb. I’ll thhow you.
I gueth I know how to climb. Buthter ith too
fat to climb a ladder. Don’t you hit me. I’ll
kick you if you do,” was her parting admonition
as she began running up the ladder. Rather
to the amazement of her companions, Grace
made the climb to the haymow without the least
difficulty. Only once did her foot slip from a
rung of the ladder. Grace recovered it with no
more than a smothered little exclamation.
</p>
<p>
“You next, Miss Elting,” nodded Harriet.
</p>
<p>
“I will wait until you get up. I wish to look
after the packs first. What would we do were
we to lose them? We shouldn’t have a thing to
eat for breakfast, and goodness knows when
we will reach a store to purchase food.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>
</p>
<p>
It was not long afterwards that the party of
young women were fussing about in the hay,
making their beds for the night. This consisted
in leveling off the hay and spreading
their blankets. Some little time was occupied
in working out the uneven spots, but after a
time they lay down with piled-up hay for pillows,
and rolled themselves in their blankets.
</p>
<p>
The girls went to sleep almost at once. Miss
Elting, however, remained awake until her
charges had finally settled down, as she supposed,
for the night. She was just about to
doze off when she was awakened by a scream
and a commotion at one end of the mow. The
guardian sprang up in alarm.
</p>
<p>
“For mercy’s sake! What is it?” she cried.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, thave me!” wailed Tommy.
</p>
<p>
Miss Elting and Harriet groped their way to
Grace.
</p>
<p>
“I got a bug in my ear. Yeth I did. It bit
me. I won’t thtay here another minute.
I’ll——”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll go out doors and sleep,” declared Margery
in disgust. “The idea of being kept
awake all night by that crazy girl.”
</p>
<p>
“Margery!” rebuked the guardian. “Now,
Tommy, you must lie down and go to sleep.
This will not do at all.”
</p>
<p>
“I will drag my blanket over and keep her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>
company, Miss Elting,” offered Harriet. “Perhaps
she did get bitten. I felt some sort of insect
crawling over my face a moment ago.
There now, Tommy, you just snuggle down and
forget all about it.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t like bugth,” complained Tommy,
somewhat mollified. A few moments later she
was sound asleep. Harriet, after making sure
that Grace was slumbering, once more permitted
herself to doze off. She had been asleep
but a few moments when a wild scream of terror
awakened them all. Harriet felt the blanket
jerked violently from her and heard a floundering
and threshing on all sides that filled her
with alarm. Stretching out her hand she found
that Tommy was no longer beside her. Tommy’s
voice rose in a loud wail of terror.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Tommy!” cried Harriet.
</p>
<p>
“Girls, girls! What <em>is</em> the matter?” exclaimed
Miss Elting.
</p>
<p>
“A mouthe, a mouthe!” shrieked Tommy.
</p>
<p>
“This isn’t a hay barn, it’s a lunatic asylum,”
scoffed Margery. “Oh, mercy! Help,
help!” she shrieked. The mouse had found
Margery too. In the darkness of the haymow
the Meadow-Brook Girls were now floundering
about in great alarm. Out of the disorder Miss
Elting quickly brought order. She spoke
sharply to Tommy, insisted that Margery
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span>
should return to her blanket and commanded the
girls to make no further disturbance.
</p>
<p>
“The idea that Meadow-Brook Girls should
be so timid,” she rebuked. “Harriet, I am
glad to know that you are not.”
</p>
<p>
“I—I think I should have screamed too if a
mouse had—how do you know it was a mouse,
Tommy?”
</p>
<p>
“It ran right over my fathe. I gueth I know
what it wath. I gueth I will thleep thanding up.
May I, Miss Elting?”
</p>
<p>
“If you prefer to do so. I am going back to
bed. I must insist on the others doing the same,
or at least keeping quiet. We shall be in no
shape to go on with our journey in the morning
at this rate.”
</p>
<p>
Tommy decided that she, too, would lie down
and soon their regular breathing told the guardian
that most, if not all, of the Meadow-Brook
Girls were sound asleep. Harriet, however,
now that she had been awakened, found it difficult
to go to sleep again. She lay staring up
into the darkness for some time.
</p>
<p>
A sound down on the barn floor put her instantly
on the alert. At first she thought some
farm animal had wandered into the barn; then
the distinct sound of human footsteps, reached
her ears.
</p>
<p>
Harriet Burrell listened intently, as yet unafraid.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>
She crawled cautiously to the edge of
the mow and peered over. A human form was
faintly outlined down there. The figure was
groping along the edge of the mow and muttering.
The listener was unable to make out
the words. At last the intruder uttered a sharp
little exclamation of satisfaction, then began to
climb the ladder on the opposite side of the
barn floor.
</p>
<p>
“It’s a woman!” gasped Harriet. “Who can
it be, and what does she want here?” With
straining ears and closed eyes the Meadow-Brook
girl listened. She heard the woman
reach the top of the ladder and step off into
the hay. A few moments later Harriet heard
her mumbling at the far side of the mow, over
near the opposite end of the hay barn. “How
strange!” muttered the girl.
</p>
<p>
A low, distant rumble of thunder attracted
her attention in another direction. A moment
later a faint flash of lightning dispelled the
gloom a little.
</p>
<p>
“The storm is coming. I hope the girls
won’t wake up.” The darkness now seemed to
be more intense than before. Harriet was unable
to distinguish one object from another.
She crawled back toward her bed and was about
to wrap herself in her blanket again when a
second time she heard footsteps on the barn
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>
floor. This time she scrambled back to the edge
more hastily than before. At first she thought
the woman had climbed down and was going
away from the mow. The girl leaned far over.
She could see no one this time, but she plainly
heard some one climbing up the opposite ladder
again. Harriet wondered if it were tramps;
then she recalled that the first visitor, being a
woman, would be unlikely to be a tramp.
</p>
<p>
“It must be some one seeking shelter from
the coming storm,” Harriet finally decided,
now wondering if it would not be advisable to
wake up Miss Elting. Upon second thought the
girl decided not to do so. Instead, she leaned
farther out over the edge of the mow and peered
down anxiously.
</p>
<p>
A flash of lightning, more brilliant than the
first, lighted up the barn from end to end. By
the light of the flash Harriet Burrell saw that
which set her nerves to tingling and caused her
to utter a suppressed gasp.
</p>
<p>
Below her on the barn floor stood a man. He
was swarthy; his coal black hair hung down
in long, glistening locks. His eyes, large and
very black were gazing right up into the girl’s
face. She shrank back trembling.
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” gasped the Meadow-Brook girl. “Oh!
He saw me. Oh, what shall I do!”
</p>
<p>
The man began climbing the ladder on her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>
side of the barn. Harriet could hear him
plainly. She began crawling back into the mow
on her hands and knees. Her first inclination,
on reaching her blanket, was to burrow under
the hay so as to be out of sight. But it occurred
to her that her companions would still
be in plain sight were another flash of lightning
to illumine the mow. Harriet promptly decided
to lie still and await developments. She knew
that Miss Elting carried a revolver, and that
the guardian was proficient in its use. This
thought gave Harriet comfort. Besides, what
was there to fear?
</p>
<p>
To add to the excitement a second man entered
the barn at this juncture. But instead of
climbing up after the other man he took the opposite
ladder up which the woman had gone a
few moments before. The man on the girls’
side was rapidly nearing the top. Harriet lay
trembling, hoping there would be no more lightning.
Suddenly a brilliant flash lighted up the
barn from end to end. It revealed the man
clinging to the ladder, his head on a level with
the top of the mow, glancing over it keenly,
searchingly. Harriet’s left hand stole toward
Miss Elting who lay within easy reach. It was
Harriet’s intention to awaken her as quietly as
possible as soon as the light died away. But
ere her hand descended on Miss Elting’s arm,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>
something occurred that made this move on Harriet
Burrell’s part, unnecessary.
</p>
<h2><a name='chII' id='chII'></a>CHAPTER II—THE RED EYE IN THE DARK</h2>
<p>
There was an ominous snapping sound;
then the rung of the ladder gave way
and the man fell backward to the floor.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! He has fallen!” gasped Harriet, in
dismay, as she scrambled hastily toward the
edge of the mow. “He must be seriously injured.”
</p>
<p>
“What ith that noithe?” demanded Grace.
</p>
<p>
“Sh-h-h!” warned Harriet softly.
</p>
<p>
Nothing more was heard from Grace for the
time being. She had dropped to sleep again.
Fortunately none of the others had been awakened
by the racket, but Harriet’s heart was
beating rapidly. She leaned over the edge of
the mow. What the next flash of lightning revealed
relieved her anxiety somewhat. She saw
the man get up and rub his back. She saw, too,
that he had fallen on a heap of hay, the latter
undoubtedly having saved him from severe injury.
A moment later he limped across the
floor and began climbing up the ladder on the
other side of the barn.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>
</p>
<p>
“Thank goodness!” muttered Harriet. “I
hope no more of them come in here to-night. I
shall scream if they do. I know I shall.”
</p>
<p>
The man threw himself, grumbling, on the
hay; silence once more settled over the barn
so far as the occupants were concerned. The
thunder was now growing louder, the lightning
flashes became more frequent. Harriet, however,
felt no particular alarm. She was unafraid
of thunder storms, and gave no thought
to the fact that barns are more frequently struck
by lightning than are dwelling houses.
</p>
<p>
By this time her companions had begun to
stir restlessly. Miss Elting sat up.
</p>
<p>
“Harriet, is that you?” she asked in a low
tone.
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“What are you doing?”
</p>
<p>
“Just looking about a little,” replied Harriet
in a whisper, not deeming it advisable to alarm
the guardian by telling her what she had just
discovered.
</p>
<p>
“How long has it been storming?” asked the
guardian.
</p>
<p>
“Only a little while. I do not believe it is
going to amount to anything. I hope this old
barn doesn’t leak.”
</p>
<p>
“No, I do not believe it will. There is too
much valuable hay here. The owner undoubtedly has seen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>
to it that the roof is sound. Are
you going to try to sleep?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
Harriet lay down, but she did not sleep. The
memory of the old woman and the two men
over in the other mow, banished all thought of
sleep from her mind. She did not know whether
the woman knew the men were there or not.
Perhaps they might belong to the same party.
However, there had been no conversation between
them and while the two men were near
the outer edge of the mow, the woman was at
the far end of the barn as nearly as Harriet
was able to determine.
</p>
<p>
Soon after that, rain drops began to patter on
the barn roof. Then it began to rain heavily.
Harriet nestled deeper into the blanket and lay
listening. There was no sound from their
neighbors on the other side.
</p>
<p>
At last the listening girl closed her eyes. No
sooner had she done so than she opened them
again. A flash of lightning, more brilliant than
any she had yet seen, was playing along the
rafters of the barn. The thunder followed the
flash just as Harriet threw an arm over her
eyes to shut out the light. It was not a particularly
heavy clap of thunder, just a quick,
sharp report. Above the report a shrill scream
of terror rang out. Then all was silent.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>
</p>
<p>
Instantly every one of the Meadow-Brook
Girls sat up wide awake.
</p>
<p>
“What—what is it?” cried Margery.
</p>
<p>
“Girls! Girls! are you all right?” called
the guardian.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, what ith it? Did the barn fall down?”
wailed Tommy in great alarm.
</p>
<p>
“What has happened?” questioned Hazel
Holland excitedly.
</p>
<p>
Harriet did not speak. She was listening to
what the others of her party had not noticed,
a sudden sound of voices in the other mow, and
the hasty clambering down the ladder of the
two men she had seen go to the opposite mow.
At least she believed it to be the two men. Evidently
they had become alarmed, either by the
lightning, the scream of the woman, or by the
cries of the Meadow-Brook Girls. They ran out
of the barn, making no attempt to go quietly.
Once on the outside she heard one of them
shout.
</p>
<p>
“I heard thome one!” exclaimed Tommy.
</p>
<p>
“So did I,” agreed Hazel.
</p>
<p>
“I thought I, too, heard some one cry out,”
said Miss Elting. “Perhaps it was a night bird
fleeing from the storm.”
</p>
<p>
“It was no night bird, Miss Elting,” said
Harriet in a low tone. “Did you hear that
scream? Some one is in trouble. There is a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span>
woman on the other side of the mow. What
shall we do?”
</p>
<p>
“A woman?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, yes. She climbed up to the mow a long
time ago. Oh, look, look!”
</p>
<p>
A tiny red eye had suddenly appeared at the
far end of the hay barn. It appeared to have
risen out of the hay at the extreme end of the
opposite mow. The girls gazed at it in silence.
They did not understand the meaning of the
strange dull red spot. Even Harriet was for
the moment, puzzled. Then all at once she understood.
</p>
<p>
“Quick! Get down to the floor! Don’t
waste a minute! Miss Elting please look after
the girls. There’s a rung on the ladder broken.
Watch that no one falls. I’m going.”
</p>
<p>
“Harriet! Harriet! What do you mean?”
</p>
<p>
“The woman! I must get her. I may want
you to help me. If I call you, come at once. Oh,
I must hurry, Miss Elting.”
</p>
<p>
“Thee! That red eye ith getting bigger,”
cried Tommy.
</p>
<p>
“It is fire, Miss Elting,” whispered Harriet.
“The barn is on fire. The last bolt of lightning
must have set fire to the hay. Don’t tell
the girls now, but get them down to the barn
floor as quickly as possible. There is going to
be an awful fire.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>
</p>
<p>
Harriet bounded toward the ladder.
</p>
<p>
“Harriet! Don’t go. I will go,” shouted the
guardian.
</p>
<p>
“I know where she is,” cried Harriet, swinging
herself to the ladder using care not to lose
her footing on the broken rung.
</p>
<p>
“The broken rung is the fifth one down,” she
called. Grasping the sides of the ladder she
permitted herself to slide all the way to the bottom,
wholly unconscious of the fact that the
skin was being scraped from the palms of her
hands.
</p>
<p>
Reaching the barn floor the girl dashed across
it to the opposite side. A few precious seconds
were lost in groping for the ladder there. She
found it, ran up with the speed of a squirrel,
then went stumbling and falling across the mow
toward the red eye that was now growing into a
great red glare.
</p>
<p>
“Where are you?” she cried, raising her
voice to a high pitch.
</p>
<p>
There was no response from her side. From
the other mow came the answer from Margery,
who did not understand: “We’re here.”
</p>
<p>
The red eye was now lighting up the far end
of the mow so that Harriet was able to see
much more clearly. Little piles of hay formed
deceiving shadows. She ran first to one, then
to another, in this way losing precious seconds.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span>
</p>
<p>
All at once the girl caught sight of a dark
object lying on the hay. She ran toward it. It
was the huddled form of an old woman, her eyes
wide and staring. Harriet feared she was
dead. The fire had already crept perilously
near to the woman. The flames at one point
had communicated with the roof and were eating
their way through it. The girls on the other
mow now realized that the barn was on fire. A
chorus of wails reached Harriet. But she knew
her companions were in good hands, that Miss
Elting would get them out safely.
</p>
<p>
Harriet grasped the old woman under the
arms and began dragging her toward the edge
of the mow.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve got her!” she screamed. “Come and
help me as soon as you can, Miss Elting. Get
the girls down and make them go outside. You
will have to hurry. The roof may fall in. Make
a rope of the blankets. We shall have to lower
her to the ground. She is helpless.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll be with you in a moment,” called the
calm, confident voice of the guardian. Miss
Elting was always to be depended upon in an
emergency. She had gotten the other girls
safely down before Harriet had called out to
her, thinking that Harriet might need her undivided
assistance in rescuing the woman from
her perilous position.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>
</p>
<p>
“Outdoors, girls, every one of you,” she commanded.
“Don’t you dare come near the barn!
Harriet is rescuing some one from the other
mow. I am going to help her. Leave the
blankets, but take the packs with you.” She
gave the protesting Tommy a push toward the
door. Hazel grasped Grace by the arm and
hurried her out of the barn. Margery needed
no assistance. She was in as great a hurry to
leave the barn as Miss Elting was to have her
do so.
</p>
<p>
The guardian climbed the ladder as rapidly
as possible, after having knotted the five
blankets into a kind of rope. She tested each
knot with her full strength; then being satisfied
that the rope would stand a heavy strain,
she began climbing the ladder holding one end
of the blanket rope. At the top of the ladder
the heat was suffocating, the smoke blinding.
Harriet was coughing and choking. She was
on the verge of collapse, having inhaled a great
deal of smoke.
</p>
<p>
“Will—will it reach?” Miss Elting gasped.
</p>
<p>
“I think so.”
</p>
<p>
“Ti—ie it under her arms. Go below to
catch her if she falls. I’ll let her down,” promised
Harriet.
</p>
<p>
“Get down yourself as fast as you can,” commanded
the guardian.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>
</p>
<p>
Harriet did not move. She buried her head
in her skirt and crouched down close to the edge
of the mow in an effort to get some fresh air,
but without very great success.
</p>
<p>
“Now go, please,” urged Harriet. “You are
strong enough to catch her if the rope breaks.
I’m not. I know how to handle it at this end.
Hurry, Miss Elting. We haven’t a second to
lose.”
</p>
<p>
Miss Elting hesitated, glanced quickly at her
companion, then started down the ladder. Harriet
took a quick turn of the rope about a beam.
Without the least hesitation, she slid the unconscious
woman over the edge of the mow feet
first. The girl prayed fervently that the rope
might hold. It did. Little by little, though as
rapidly as she dared, the girl lowered her burden.
Sparks were flying all about her. She
stood enveloped in a cloud of smoke, but not
for an instant did the girl give thought to her
own perilous position.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve got her,” screamed Miss Elting.
“Come down. Be quick, oh do be quick.”
</p>
<p>
Harriet’s fingers released the rope. She
staggered toward the ladder groping blindly
for it. Reaching it she sank down choking.
</p>
<p>
“Can you make it?” called the guardian.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” was the faint reply. “Get—get her
out.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>
</p>
<p>
Miss Elting seeing that Harriet was coming
down the ladder, hastily dragged the unconscious
woman out into the open air. The way
seemed endless to the descending girl. About
half way down her fingers relaxed. Harriet
fell, landing heavily in a heap on the barn floor.
She lay where she had fallen, with the flames
crackling overhead as they leaped across the
intervening space and began devouring the mow
on the opposite side.
</p>
<h2><a name='chIII' id='chIII'></a>CHAPTER III—A BLESSING AND A THREAT</h2>
<p>
From end to end of the great hay barn
the roof was now wrapped in flames.
Now the stacks at the rear began blazing.
The entire building was doomed to destruction.
In the meantime, Miss Elting, having
dragged the woman to a point of safety,
was working to revive her. So engrossed was
she that, for the moment, all thought of Harriet
Burrell escaped her until she was reminded
of Harriet by Tommy.
</p>
<p>
“Where ith Harriet?” piped Tommy.
</p>
<p>
“Harriet? Oh!” gasped the guardian.
</p>
<p>
Tommy understood without further explanation
and darted toward the barn, with Miss
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span>
Elting running after her to bring her back. But
there was no stopping Tommy when once she
had started to carry out a resolve. She ran to
the barn on winged feet and plunged into the
dense cloud of smoke that issued from the burning barn.
The little girl had no idea what she
would do when she got there, and perhaps she
might have been injured before Miss Elting
reached her, had Tommy not fallen accidently
over Harriet. The latter was unconscious from
the smoke she had inhaled. Tommy grabbed
her by the arms and began dragging her out.
The little girl had gotten to the door with her
burden as Miss Elting reached the scene.
</p>
<p>
“Brave Tommy!” cried the guardian. “You
shall have a whole string of Camp Girls’ beads
for this. Let Harriet lie where she is for the
present. Place her on her back so the rain may
beat in her face. She will be all right in a few
moments.”
</p>
<p>
Miss Elting did not know that Harriet had
fallen, and that it was not only the smoke but
the shock of the fall as well that had overcome
her.
</p>
<p>
“But, thuppothe the barn fallth down!” exclaimed
Tommy.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, you are right. We must get her
farther away.” Together they carried Harriet
out to the place where the old woman lay.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span>
When they reached there the old woman was
sitting up looking about her in a dazed manner.
Shouts and cries off toward the highway told
the little company that men were hastening to
the scene of the fire.
</p>
<p>
Harriet became conscious in a short time, but
she had frequent coughing spells for some minutes.
</p>
<p>
“That ith right. Cough up all the thmoke,”
suggested Tommy wisely. “You’ll feel better
after you get the thmoke out of your thythtem.
I know, for I thwallowed a lot of thmoke once.”
</p>
<p>
The men ran past the party of women, shouting
and gesticulating. There were a dozen of
them. Others could be heard approaching the
scene of the fire. Harriet, as soon as she was
able to talk, and the coughing spells became less
frequent, went over to the woman she had
rescued. The swarthy complexion, straight
black hair, and piercing black eyes of the woman
were the same characteristics that Harriet had
observed in the man who had fallen from the
ladder.
</p>
<p>
“Do you feel better?” questioned Harriet,
smiling a little.
</p>
<p>
The old woman nodded, her eyes never leaving
the face of her questioner for an instant.
</p>
<p>
“You have this young woman to thank for
being alive,” Miss Elting informed the old
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span>
woman, stepping up to her and nodding toward
Harriet.
</p>
<p>
“You saved me, eh?” questioned the
stranger, looking searchingly at the girl.
</p>
<p>
Harriet did not reply, but Miss Elting answered
for her.
</p>
<p>
“You saved Sybarina from fire from the
skies?” insisted the woman.
</p>
<p>
“She means the lightning,” suggested Hazel.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, she did,” repeated Miss Elting. “She
climbed the ladder to the hay loft and let you
down with blankets tied together. Our blankets
are there yet.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I forgot them,” cried Harriet. “How
thoughtless of me! Now we shall have nothing
to sleep in.”
</p>
<p>
“Never mind the blankets. We have others
in the car.”
</p>
<p>
“You saved Sybarina?” repeated the old
woman, staggering to her feet. She had been
temporarily paralyzed from the electric bolt,
and was as yet barely able to stand on her feet.
</p>
<p>
“Please don’t mention it,” urged Harriet,
flushing.
</p>
<p>
The old woman seized Harriet’s hand and
gazed deeply into it by the light of the burning
barn. As she gazed she swayed her body from
side to side with quick, nervous movements.
</p>
<p>
“Ah! Sybarina sees that which pleases her,”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span>
crooned the old woman. “She sees a noble
girl whom the fires from the skies cannot
frighten. And she sees more. She sees wealth
and happiness and a great future for her who
fears not the fire from above. Sybarina gives
you her blessing.”
</p>
<p>
A heavy hand was laid on the old woman’s
shoulder.
</p>
<p>
“Here, you Gipsy woman. Were you sleeping
in that barn?” demanded a gruff voice.
</p>
<p>
“I met two Gipsy men running across the
fields to the west as I came down,” answered
another male voice. “The Gipsies are camped
about a mile and a half from here. I think we
ought to arrest the old woman, don’t you,
Squire?”
</p>
<p>
“Sybarina was asleep in the barn,” admitted
the Gipsy woman.
</p>
<p>
“And you set the barn on fire, too,” declared
the squire. “I’ll have to arrest you.”
</p>
<p>
“She didn’t set the barn on fire, sir,” defended
Harriet Burrell.
</p>
<p>
“The fires from the skies made the barn
burn,” announced the Gipsy woman.
</p>
<p>
“Who are you?” demanded the man, turning
sharply to Harriet. “I suppose you will
tell me <em>you</em> weren’t sleeping in my barn?”
</p>
<p>
“On the contrary, we were,” interjected Miss
Elting.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>
</p>
<p>
“Then I arrest the whole parcel of you.”
</p>
<p>
“Thave me!” wailed Tommy Thompson.
“We didn’t thet your old barn on fire. We
were jutht thleeping there, that wath all.”
</p>
<p>
“You will all stay here till I get through
with this fire; then I’ll hold court on you and
if you don’t answer to suit me I’ll have you all
over to the county seat to-morrow.”
</p>
<p>
“No one set your barn on fire, sir,” declared
Harriet, with emphasis. “The barn was struck
by lightning.”
</p>
<p>
“Did you see it?”
</p>
<p>
“I can’t say that I saw the lightning strike,
but I saw the flash, then saw the fire start up
directly afterwards. I heard this woman
scream and we hurried to her rescue. She was
unconscious. The bolt had nearly killed her.
That proves that it was lightning, not matches,
that set your barn on fire.”
</p>
<p>
“What were you doing in my barn?”
</p>
<p>
“Thleeping with the mithe and the bugth,”
volunteered Tommy.
</p>
<p>
“Who be you? You ain’t Gipsies?”
</p>
<p>
“No. We are from Meadow-Brook, and we
are walking home from the Pocono Woods,
where we have been spending the summer in
camp,” Miss Elting informed the man.
</p>
<p>
“So, that’s it, hey?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir. A young woman friend of ours
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span>
usually meets us at night. She has our equipment
in her automobile, but we took the wrong
trail to-day, and have lost her. She is over in
the other valley waiting for us, I think.”
</p>
<p>
“Is she a crazy woman with light hair that
streams over her shoulders, and does she drive
her car as though she was running a race?”
</p>
<p>
“From your description I think you must
have met Miss McCarthy,” answered the guardian,
smiling a little. “Have you seen her to-day?”
</p>
<p>
“I should say I had. She nigh killed a calf
of mine this afternoon. I’d just like to get my
grip on her once. I’d make her answer to the
law.”
</p>
<p>
“Was your calf in the road, sir?” questioned
Harriet.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. What of it?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t believe the law would do anything
to Miss McCarthy in that case. Of course I am
sorry for the calf,” said Harriet.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, the calf ain’t hurt. Jest lost a little
hair off her tail, shaved off as close as ye could
do it with a razor. But that don’t matter. It’s
the barn and nigh onto a hundred tons of hay
gone up in smoke that bothers me. I wisht I
was sure you was telling the truth. If I
thought you weren’t I’d have you all in the lock-up
afore morning.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>
</p>
<p>
“Are—are there any mithe in the lock-up?”
questioned Tommy apprehensively.
</p>
<p>
“Eh? Stacks all gone, too?” This in answer
to a word from a farmer who came from
the rear of the burning barn. “Well, let ’em
go. There’ll be another crop of hay next year.
Mebby the price’ll be better then.”
</p>
<p>
The loss of his barn did not appear to trouble
the “Squire” greatly. All the time he was
talking he was regarding the women out of the
corners of his eyes. He saw that they were
drenched through and through. Tommy and
Margery were shivering. He decided that they
were persons of some consequence, even if they
had been sleeping in his barn. His reflections
were interrupted by Miss Elting.
</p>
<p>
“Can you tell me which way the young woman
and the car went?”
</p>
<p>
“Can I? I guess I can. She went east. The
calf could tell ye, too, if she could talk, but she
wouldn’t say it quite so easy like as I’m tellin’
you now.”
</p>
<p>
“Jane was looking for us,” nodded Miss Elting.
“She must have reasoned that we had
gotten into this valley by mistake.”
</p>
<p>
“Where you going to stay the rest of the
night?” questioned the squire gruffly.
</p>
<p>
“I am afraid we shall have to stay out in the
rain if we don’t succeed in finding another
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>
barn,” laughed the guardian. “My girls are
pretty well used to roughing it, though they
never before passed quite such a night as this
has been. Do you know of a farm house nearby
where we may get lodgings? We are perfectly
willing to sleep on the floor in the kitchen, provided
we can have the room to dry out our
clothes, and we shall be glad and willing to pay
for the trouble.”
</p>
<p>
“You may come home with me,” answered
the man, after a brief hesitation.
</p>
<p>
“What is your name, sir?” questioned Miss
Elting.
</p>
<p>
“Squire Olney, Miss. You see I ain’t a
squire by appointment. The neighbors jest call
me that because I settle their difficulties. I’ve
got more land in this township than all the rest
of them put together. That’s why I ain’t takin’
the burnin’ of the barn to heart so much as you
think I ought to,” he added, with a broad smile.
</p>
<p>
“Have you a family at home?” questioned
Miss Elting.
</p>
<p>
“My wife and I are alone. Children all married.”
</p>
<p>
“How far is it from here to your home, sir?”
</p>
<p>
“About a mile right over the hill. What do
you say?”
</p>
<p>
“We will go with you. We thank you for
your kindness. I am very sorry, indeed, that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>
you have lost your barn and your hay,” said
the guardian in a sympathetic tone.
</p>
<p>
The squire leaned toward her.
</p>
<p>
“I ain’t lost anything,” he said, with a wink.
“Insured. Insured plumb up to the muzzle,
and then some more. Boys, I’m going home to
show the ladies the way. You can have all the
hay that’s left. I want the ashes for fertilizer.
Ashes is good for the cut worms in the cabbage
patch. Come on, ladies.”
</p>
<p>
Squire Olney nodded to them and started
away. He halted sharply.
</p>
<p>
“Where’s that old Gipsy woman? She ain’t
included in the invitation.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, she has gone,” exclaimed Hazel. “I
didn’t see her go. Did you, Harriet?”
</p>
<p>
Harriet Burrell shook her head. She was
puzzled at the mysterious disappearance of
Sybarina, who had given her rescuer her blessing,
then so strangely slipped away.
</p>
<p>
The walk over the hill did not add to the
comfort of the Meadow-Brook Girls. They
splashed through deep puddles of water in the
little hollows, slipped and stumbled over bare
clay spots, fell over stones and roots until they
were not only soaked to the skin, but badly
bruised as well. Margery wailed and groaned
all the way. Tommy made fun of her until they
came in sight of the lights in the farm house.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>
</p>
<p>
“That’s the old shack that has covered us
for nigh onto fifty years,” he said, nodding toward
the light in the window.
</p>
<p>
The light and the comfortable looking old
farm house made the Meadow-Brook Girls almost
forget their sodden condition. Mrs. Olney
was standing on the front porch, gazing down
across the field. She recognized the squire’s
voice, but she was at a loss to understand who
his companions were.
</p>
<p>
“Hello, Martha,” he sang out, as he crossed
the road with his party.
</p>
<p>
“That you, Squire?”
</p>
<p>
“Yep. Me and the girls. Barn all burned
down, but I’ve brought the leavings. Me and
the girls is all right, Martha. But they’re wetter
than Old Sixty. Poke up the kitchen fire
and let them dry their clothing.”
</p>
<p>
Miss Elting stepped forward and shook hands
with Mrs. Olney, briefly explaining how they
came to be there at that time of the night.
</p>
<p>
“Female tramps. Got fired from sleepin’ in
the squire’s hay barn,” chuckled the old man.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Olney led the way into the house, where
she turned and surveyed her callers critically.
</p>
<p>
“Why, you poor things!” she cried, when she
had gotten a good look at the Meadow-Brook
Girls. “And you sleepin’ in the barn. It’s a
shame,” she exclaimed, bustling about.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>
“Squire, you tend to that fire yerself. I’ll git
out some dry clothing for these girls. Then I’ll
see about making some coffee and getting them
something to eat. Come into my bedroom, my
dears and change your wet clothes.”
</p>
<p>
“I am afraid that we are putting you to a
great deal of trouble,” demurred Miss Elting.
</p>
<p>
“Not a bit of it,” rejoined Mrs. Olney. “Come
right along with me.”
</p>
<p>
Half an hour later, Miss Elting and the
Meadow-Brook Girls clothed in dressing gowns
and wrappers belonging to the hospitable Mrs.
Olney sat in the big farm house kitchen doing
full justice to the luncheon provided by the
farmer’s wife. After their exciting experiences
of the night the girls were tired enough
to gladly welcome the opportunity of sleeping
in a real bed, and in spite of their late repast
the five wayworn travelers slept peacefully, unvisited
by nightmares.
</p>
<h2><a name='chIV' id='chIV'></a>CHAPTER IV—THE COMING OF CRAZY JANE</h2>
<p>
After bidding good-bye to the hospitable
squire and his good wife, next morning,
the girls started over the fields on their
way down the valley on the other side of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span>
ridge. Before leaving they had pressed their
camp dresses and the girls now looked very
neat in their dark blue uniforms that they had
worn at Camp Wau-Wau. They wore also the
official hat of the Camp Girls, to which organization
they belonged. The hat was of blue cloth
with the letters “C. G.” in white embroidered
on the front.
</p>
<p>
About their necks the girls wore a few
brightly colored beads which to them meant
more than precious stones, for each girl had
won her beads by achievements as a Camp Girl.
They hoped to win more on the long tramp
across country. Harriet and Tommy had won
several beads apiece, already, by their bravery
at the barn fire, though of course the beads had
not been awarded as yet. That would not be
until after Miss Elting had made her report to
the Chief Guardian at the completion of the
trip.
</p>
<p>
The girls were now well on their way hoping
soon to find Jane McCarthy and her car awaiting
them. It was a five mile tramp over rough
and steep hills, through woods and ravines. By
this time however the Meadow-Brook Girls were
becoming accustomed to rough traveling. The
only one who made any really serious complaints
was Margery Brown. She was usually
in distress, but it was observed that the stout
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span>
girl was beginning to lose considerable flesh.
Her freckles were more pronounced, however,
and her face was redder than it ever had been
before.
</p>
<p>
The party, after a trying hike, reached the
top of the range of hills about eleven o’clock
in the morning. A long, sloping meadow
stretched away from them until it met the highway.
</p>
<p>
“There is the road,” cried Harriet.
</p>
<p>
“But Crazy Jane ith nowhere in thight,” observed
Tommy solemnly.
</p>
<p>
“This is where we should have been last
night,” nodded Miss Elting. “But we should
have missed all of our exciting experiences of
last night had we taken the right trail.”
</p>
<p>
“Missed them!” exclaimed Margery. “I
wish we had. I never shall get over thinking
about that awful fire and that horrid old Gipsy
woman.”
</p>
<p>
Harriet smiled to herself thinking that it was
well that Margery had not seen the dark-faced
men enter the barn that night.
</p>
<p>
“Shall we wait, or go on?” questioned Harriet.
</p>
<p>
Miss Elting decided that they should go on
after reaching the highway. She told the girls
to keep a sharp lookout for “signs.” The sign
of the Meadow-Brook Girls was a triangle. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span>
might be found chalked on a fence or elsewhere
by the roadside. An arrow pointing away from
the triangle indicated the direction in which a
Meadow-Brook girl had traveled. An arrow
pointing straight up indicated, “I will return.”
An arrow pointing toward the ground meant,
“wait here.” A broken arrow, pointing in any
direction indicated, “danger.”
</p>
<p>
Reaching the highway the girls scanned the
fences. Most of these being wire fences there
was no space for any of the signs that they had
agreed upon before starting out on their tramp.
Occasionally they halted to examine a sign
board at the junction of two or more roads, but
nowhere did they find any trace of Jane and
her car. There were not even tire tracks in the
road. The pedestrians had almost made up
their minds that Crazy Jane herself had missed
her way when Harriet suddenly held up her
hand.
</p>
<p>
“I hear the honk of a motor horn,” she said.
</p>
<p>
“And there’s the sign on that hog pen,”
laughed Miss Elting, pointing to a pig sty close
to where they were standing. “That’s just like
Jane. The arrow says we are to wait here.”
</p>
<p>
“A pig pen ith thertainly a nithe plathe to
wait,” observed Tommy sarcastically.
</p>
<p>
“We don’t have to wait in the pen, you
goose,” jeered Margery.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>
</p>
<p>
“Tho I thee,” answered Tommy imperturbably.
</p>
<p>
“There she comes!” shouted Hazel.
</p>
<p>
Crazy Jane McCarthy, her blonde hair
streaming over her shoulders, rounded a bend in
the road, the rear wheels of her car skidding
nearly to the ditch on the outside of the curve.
Jane was shouting and waving one hand. She
brought the car up sliding and leaped to the
ground.
</p>
<p>
“You dears! Where have you been?” she
cried, embracing each of the girls in turn, not
forgetting Miss Elting.
</p>
<p>
“The question, is where have you been?”
laughed the guardian.
</p>
<p>
“Racing up and down the road looking for
you,” returned Jane.
</p>
<p>
“Where did you sleep?” questioned Harriet.
</p>
<p>
“At a farm house over in the valley,”
chuckled Jane. “Where did you sleep?”
</p>
<p>
“We were in a barn part of the night. Regular
tramps, aren’t we,” answered Harriet, her
eyes sparkling.
</p>
<p>
“Yeth, and—and the barn burned down,” explained
Grace.
</p>
<p>
“What?”
</p>
<p>
“Grace is right,” Miss Elting informed
Jane. “Lightning struck the barn, burning it
to the ground. Harriet saved an old Gipsy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>
woman from being burned to death. She had
been stunned by the bolt of lightning and for
the time being was paralyzed.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, what a shame!” exclaimed Jane. “I
always have to be absent when the fun is going
on. Think of poor me tearing up and down the
road, half crazy because I’d lost you and you
having so much fun all the time,” she complained.
“Who was the woman you saved,
darlin’?” she questioned, turning admiring
eyes on Harriet Burrell.
</p>
<p>
“A Gipsy. She called herself Sybarina,” answered
Harriet.
</p>
<p>
“And did the Gipsy tell your fortune, Harriet?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, she did,” cried Margery. “She said
Harriet was going to be a great lady, rich and
some other things that I didn’t understand.
Then Sybarina gave Harriet her blessing.”
</p>
<p>
“Now, Jane,” said Harriet mischievously.
“Tell us about the way you ran down the farmer’s
calf.”
</p>
<p>
Jane gazed at Harriet frowningly, then burst
into laughter.
</p>
<p>
“What do you know about that? Who has
been telling tales?”
</p>
<p>
“The farmer said you shaved the hair off the
calf’s tail with your car.”
</p>
<p>
“I was sorry for the calf, but you ought to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span>
have seen the farmer wave his arms and run
after me. He was fairly pulling the hair out of
his head with rage,” chuckled Crazy Jane.
“Well, dears, what have you in mind? Want
to take a nice ride in the car?”
</p>
<p>
Harriet shook her head with emphasis.
</p>
<p>
“When we started on this tramp we agreed
that we wouldn’t ride in your car at all. I, for
one, am going to keep to that agreement.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t tempt me,” said Hazel, chancing to
catch the merry eye of Jane McCarthy.
</p>
<p>
“We didn’t agree not to eat in the car, did
we?” questioned Tommy. “That latht gully I
fell into gave me an awful appetite.”
</p>
<p>
“Wait! I’ll set the table,” cried Jane, dashing
to the car and unlocking the luggage trunk
at the rear. From under the rear seat she took
a board, which she laid across the rear compartment.
Over this she spread a white cloth
and on it began placing a cold luncheon that
was sufficiently appetizing in looks to excite the
poorest appetite. Tommy eyed it longingly.
</p>
<p>
“Get in, girls,” commanded Jane. They
made a rush for the car. “I have a can of
milk in the locker, if the jolting of this old wagon
hasn’t soured it. You see, I drove rather fast
this morning. I wanted to find you. I didn’t
know what had become of you. Yes; the milk
is all right.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span>
</p>
<p>
There in Jane’s car by the side of the road
they ate their luncheon, giving no heed to the
curious glances of passers-by.
</p>
<p>
“Did the farmer really tell you about that
calf?” questioned Jane, when the girls had
nearly finished their meal.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. It was in his barn we slept until it
caught fire,” explained the guardian. “He
then took us to his home and he and his wife
were perfectly lovely to us. I wish you had
been with us. He is a quaint character.”
</p>
<p>
“If he is anything like his calf, he must be,”
observed Crazy Jane. “It didn’t know enough
to get out of the road when it saw an automobile
coming at forty-five miles an hour. Where
are you going from here?”
</p>
<p>
“We must consult the map. Are there any
good camping places beyond here, or were you
going so fast you couldn’t see?”
</p>
<p>
“I never drive so fast that I can’t see,” reproved
Jane. “Yes. I know of a place, and
it’s a fine place for a camp too. It’s called the
Willow Ponds. It is just far enough back from
the road, and there isn’t a house in sight.”
</p>
<p>
“How far is it from here?” asked Hazel.
</p>
<p>
“Five miles.”
</p>
<p>
“Five mileth!” repeated Tommy wearily.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, help!” wailed Margery. “My feet
won’t hold out.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>
</p>
<p>
“Then ride with me,” suggested Jane.
</p>
<p>
“Thank you,” returned Margery, “but I consider
walking the lesser of the two evils.”
</p>
<p>
“I fear it will make too short a hike for us,
for one day,” reflected Miss Elting.
</p>
<p>
“It will make a ten mile hike,” answered Harriet.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. But only five miles of walking on the
main trail. We shall have advanced only five
miles. However, perhaps it will be enough for
one day.”
</p>
<p>
“That latht gully I fell into gave me an awful
appetite,” reiterated Tommy apologetically,
as she helped herself to another slice of cold
roast beef.
</p>
<p>
“Tommy’s appetite doesn’t need that kind of
stimulant,” laughed Hazel. “Nor does mine.
I think I shall have to have another slice of
roast beef.”
</p>
<p>
The luncheon ended, the girls reclined on the
soft cushions of the car for half an hour, after
which Harriet and Jane put away the dishes and
the rest of the food.
</p>
<p>
“Are we ready to hike?” asked Harriet.
</p>
<p>
Margery’s face took on a pained expression.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I suppose so,” she complained. “The
sooner we start the sooner we shall get there.
Then a long night’s rest in our own tent. Oh,
joy, oh, joy!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span>
</p>
<p>
“It may not be so very joyous, after all,”
retorted Miss Elting. “In this topsy-turvy bit
of country <em>anything</em> may happen, at <em>any</em> moment,
to keep us awake, or even to banish the
wish for sleep.”
</p>
<p>
“What we need,” said Tommy soberly, “ith
a nithe, good-natured dog that will bite folkth.”
</p>
<p>
Miss Elting decided that it was time to start.
So shouldering their packs the girls moved on.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll be driving behind you,” said Crazy Jane.
“I’ll be pace-maker. If you lag I’ll remonstrate
by riding over you! How will you like
that?”
</p>
<p>
Miss Elting and Harriet set a good stride.
The other girls straggled after them, Margery
being last of all. Behind them all Jane drove
the car slowly, the engine making no noise.
</p>
<p>
“We must walk faster, girls!” cried Miss
Elting, looking back. “You, especially, Margery.
Faster!”
</p>
<p>
“I couldn’t move any faster,” protested Margery
wearily “even if I were paid for it.”
</p>
<p>
Honk! Honk! Honk! sounded an automobile
horn behind her. There was a whirr of fast-moving
wheels.
</p>
<p>
HONK!
</p>
<p>
Turning, Margery saw the car bearing down
upon her at full speed.
</p>
<p>
“O-o-o-h!” screamed Margery. Picking up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span>
her skirts a trifle she fled down the road, while
Jane stopped the car just behind her.
</p>
<p>
“I’m sorry you can’t move fast!” Jane
called, teasingly.
</p>
<p>
Twice after that Crazy Jane forced Margery
to quicken her lagging steps until at length poor
Margery stepped aside, out of the road.
</p>
<p>
“Not another step for me, Jane McCarthy,
unless you keep ahead of the whole party,” declared
the persecuted Camp Girl.
</p>
<p>
“Get in and ride,” teased Jane.
</p>
<p>
“I—I believe I will,” faltered Margery, who
was limping now.
</p>
<p>
“Margery!” exclaimed Harriet rebukingly,
“if you ride, then you will have to drop out
of the hike, and we’ll send you home.”
</p>
<p>
“I—I think I’ll keep on walking,” Margery
decided meekly.
</p>
<p>
The rest of the journey was accomplished
without further complaints from either Tommy
or Margery. Arriving at a place where they
left the road and set off across a field, Jane
explained that earlier in the day she had asked
the permission of the owner of the field to camp
there. She thought it would make an excellent
camp site, the ponds being screened from the
road by a heavy growth of willows, and there
was plenty of dry wood to be had from the ruins
of an old saw mill that stood near the ponds.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span>
The willows, also, would serve to hide the camp
from the gaze of curious outsiders, a condition
to be desired by young women tramping through
the country.
</p>
<p>
The car was driven in among the willows,
after which Harriet and Miss Elting began hauling
the sections of their tent from the rear of
the car. They went at the pitching of the tent
like veterans, and placed the sections together,
then raised the canvas, staking it down with the
expertness of circusmen.
</p>
<p>
Harriet left the final staking-down to Tommy
and Margery while she gathered the wood for
the campfire. Jane and Miss Elting, in the
meantime had begun getting out the supplies
for supper. Two folding tables were set up in
the tent, covered by fresh table cloths, on
which were placed the dishes and the silver
knives, forks and spoons that Jane had brought
along. She said silver was none too good for
the Meadow-Brook Girls. The water in the
pond, being from nearby springs, was cool and
refreshing. The girls decided to take a swim
late in the evening after their suppers had been
well digested.
</p>
<p>
It was a merry party of happy, brown-faced
girls that sat down to the evening meal with
the cheerful campfire blazing just outside, and
the cool, fragrant autumn breezes drifting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>
through the tent. Everything was charmingly
peaceful, but the peace of the night was to be
rudely disturbed later in the evening, and the
girls were to have another exciting time of it
ere they finally got to sleep.
</p>
<h2><a name='chV' id='chV'></a>CHAPTER V—CATCHING THE SPECKLED BEAUTIES</h2>
<p>
“Oh, girls, let’s stay here the rest of the
fall. Let’s not walk any more,”
begged Margery.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, thee the fithh jump!” cried Tommy,
pointing to the pond.
</p>
<p>
“Trout, too. If I only had a rod and line!”
exclaimed Harriet.
</p>
<p>
“You shall have them, darlin’,” answered
Jane. “If you want anything you don’t see,
just ask for it. You’ll find the whole fisherman’s
outfit strapped under the car—under the
left mudguard. What about bait?”
</p>
<p>
“I think the trout will take flies. That is
what they are jumping for,” replied Harriet.
“Where will I find the flies?”
</p>
<p>
“In the box under the rear seat.”
</p>
<p>
“Thay, Harriet!” piped Tommy.
</p>
<p>
“Yes?”
</p>
<p>
“Catch me an oythter for breakfatht.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>
</p>
<p>
Harriet paused from jointing Jane’s rod
long enough to join in the merriment at
Tommy’s expense.
</p>
<p>
“Have you a dusty miller, Jane?” she asked,
glancing up with flushed face.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know whether or not he’s dusty,
but there’s an insect in there that they call a
miller. Dad says it’s a killer. I never saw it
show its teeth. It’s my opinion that it would
be a fool fish that would bite a thing like that.”
</p>
<p>
“You wait and see,” chuckled Harriet, fixing
the leader of the fly to the silk line, then
balancing the rod by its butt, swinging the line
this way and that through the air to see how
the reel worked.
</p>
<p>
“It will be too late by the time you get ready
to fish,” reminded Miss Elting.
</p>
<p>
“It isn’t sunset yet, Miss Elting. There
should be good fishing for half an hour yet.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, are you going to fish, or are you going
to talk all the time during that half hour?”
demanded Margery.
</p>
<p>
For answer Harriet swung the pole above her
head. With a swish the dusty miller described
a long curve in the air, then dived for the water,
which it took with the faintest possible disturbance.
</p>
<p>
There followed a swish and a splash. The
rod bent until it seemed to the spectators as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>
though it would break under the strain. A
flashing, scintillating body jumped through the
air, then plunged down deep into the clear
waters of the pond.
</p>
<p>
“A fithh! A fithh!” screamed Tommy.
“Harriet hath got a fithh. Oh, goodie, goodie,
goodie!”
</p>
<p>
“Pull him in. You’ll lose him!” shouted
Margery.
</p>
<p>
“Now will you look at our Harriet?” cried
Crazy Jane, hugging herself gleefully, swaying
her body from side to side in the ecstasy of her
delight.
</p>
<p>
The trout that Harriet Burrell had hooked
was a lively fish. It was darting and diving
with wonderful strength and quickness. The
line cut the water with a swish, swish, swish
that was plainly heard by all.
</p>
<p>
“Get it, Harriet! Oh, do get it,” begged
Hazel, in an agony of apprehension lest the
trout succeed in freeing itself.
</p>
<p>
“The real fun of catching a fish is ‘playing’
it, just as Harriet is doing,” answered Miss
Elting.
</p>
<p>
Tommy had run out on one of the beams of
the old mill race, where she was dancing up
and down at the imminent risk of a ducking.
</p>
<p>
“Now, look out, girls,” warned Harriet.
“I’m going to try to land him.” There was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>
a lively scurrying on the part of the girls. The
trout came up protesting and fighting every
inch of the way. Then Harriet, having reeled
in the line, pulled the trout in toward the bank.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately for Harriet, but fortunately
for the fish, Tommy Thompson was in the way.
The trout slapped her squarely in the face ere
Harriet had discovered her companion’s location.
There was a shrill scream from Tommy,
a light splash as the trout dropped into the
pond, then a mighty splash as Tommy, losing
her balance, went sprawling into the cold water.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I have lost my fish!” wailed Harriet.
</p>
<p>
“Catch Tommy!” yelled Margery.
</p>
<p>
Harriet threw down her rod and ran out on
the beam where Tommy had been standing before
the disaster. Tommy was splashing and
coughing, making frantic efforts to reach shore.
Harriet knew the little blonde girl could swim,
else she would have gone in after her. But
Tommy wished to attract all the sympathy and
attention of her companions in her direction,
so she kept up a continuous screaming. Harriet
reached down and gave her a hand.
</p>
<p>
“How’s the water, Tommy?” questioned Harriet,
mischievously.
</p>
<p>
“Co-o-o-old,” chattered Tommy. “I’m
fr-r-r-r-eezing. What did you knock me in
for?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>
</p>
<p>
“Why, I didn’t realize that you were standing
there. Why did you make me lose my
fish?”
</p>
<p>
“There, there, girls! Tommy go into the tent
at once and take off your wet clothing. Put
on dry clothes unless you wish to go to bed
now.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t want to go to bed, I want to watch
Harriet catch fithh.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, you’ve scared them all out of the pond,”
complained Margery.
</p>
<p>
“I hope you fall in, too, Buthter,” was
Tommy’s parting salute, as she ran shivering to
the tent. Fifteen minutes later, she emerged
clad in dry clothing and apparently none the
worse for her recent wetting.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime Harriet had returned to her
fishing, laughing softly over her companion’s
mishap and their argument following the
plunge. There were screams of delight when
finally she landed a trout. Nor did she stop
until the sun dipped behind the western hills
and the speckled beauties went down into the
depths of the stream, or skulked under the edge
of its banks for the night. The result of the
fishing was a dozen fine trout, the smallest
weighing only a little under a half pound and
the largest weighing nearly two pounds, according
to the guardian’s estimate.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span>
</p>
<p>
Harriet insisted on dressing the fish that
night, something she knew better how to do
than did any of her companions. The fish were
then put in a pail, the cover tightly fitted and
the pail hung in the old mill race, where the
cold water would flow over the receptacle all
night long.
</p>
<p>
“There,” exclaimed Harriet after her work
was finished. “We shall have a breakfast fit
for a king. Now I’m going in bathing. I am
so covered with dust and grime that I’m
ashamed of myself. Come, girls, aren’t you
going in with me?”
</p>
<p>
“What! Go into that ice cold water?” demanded
Margery. “No, thank you. I’ll heat
some water and take my bath in the tent.”
</p>
<p>
“I will go in with you, Harriet,” offered
Hazel.
</p>
<p>
“So will I,” added the guardian. “Come,
let’s get ready before the air gets colder.
Tommy already has had her bath.”
</p>
<p>
Had they not been inured to cold water and
exposure, the experiment might have been followed
by severe colds if nothing worse. But
the Meadow-Brook Girls were well seasoned
from living out of doors for the greater part
of the summer and from bathing in the cold
stream at Camp Wau-Wau. The first plunge
into the pond brought gasps and shivers, then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>
they splashed about in the water, swimming
across the pond and back, again and again,
while Margery stood on the bank shivering out
of pure sympathy for them.
</p>
<p>
“That is what I call great,” cried Harriet,
rising dripping to the bank after Miss Elting
had called to the two girls to come out of the
water. “I could almost eat another meal after
that bath.”
</p>
<p>
“Tho could I,” piped Tommy, thrusting her
head out from the tent flap.
</p>
<p>
The two girls and the guardian ran laughing
to the tent, where, greatly refreshed by their
cold plunge, they changed their wet bathing
suits for dry clothing.
</p>
<p>
Now fresh fuel was piled on the camp fire.
The flames blazed high and the smoke curled
skyward in the still, clear evening air. Harriet
and Hazel were capering about the fire,
holding an impromptu war dance. Tommy was
standing near one corner of the tent watching
the performance, when, thinking she had heard
a sound behind her, she turned apprehensively.
</p>
<p>
For one horrified moment Tommy Thompson
gazed, then with a yell of terror sprang for the
tent.
</p>
<p>
“Thave me! Oh, thave me!” she screamed.
</p>
<p>
“What is it?” cried Harriet and Miss Elting,
rushing toward her. Then they, too, halted,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>
gazing into the deepening shadows that enveloped
the rear of the tent. Margery had caught
sight of the object that had sent Tommy into
an agony of terror. Margery had thrown herself
headlong into the tent screaming wildly.
Hazel, Miss Elting and Harriet stood their
ground.
</p>
<h2><a name='chVI' id='chVI'></a>CHAPTER VI—THE CALL OF THE DANCING BEAR</h2>
<p>
“A bear! A bear! Thave me!” came
Tommy’s wailing voice from the interior
of the tent.
</p>
<p>
“Be quiet!” commanded Miss Elting.
</p>
<p>
“It’s on a chain. There are two men with
it,” said Harriet somewhat unsteadily.
</p>
<p>
Miss Elting stepped forward to obtain a better
view of the two men. She saw the swarthy
faces of two Italians. One was leading the bear
by a chain, the other carried a long pole. The
animal was a huge, ambling, cinnamon bear.
He wore a muzzle, and the sight of this gave
the woman and the two girls a greater sense
of security.
</p>
<p>
“What do you wish here?” demanded the
guardian.
</p>
<p>
“We maka da bear dance,” said the man,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span>
with the pole, touching his hat politely. “You
giva mea twent-five cent I maka da bear dance.”
</p>
<p>
“We do not wish to see the bear dance. You
will please go away, or I shall call for assistance
to drive you off,” returned Miss Elting
boldly.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, let the bear dance. It would be great
fun,” urged Hazel.
</p>
<p>
“Twent-five cent to maka da bear dance.”
</p>
<p>
At this juncture Margery came timidly out
of the tent. Tommy, white-faced, ready to run
at the slightest sign of alarm, crept out after
her.
</p>
<p>
“Will—will he bite?” stammered Margery.
</p>
<p>
“He will hurt his teeth on the muzzle if he
does,” answered Harriet Burrell laughingly.
</p>
<p>
The leader gave a sharp command. The bear
rose on its hind feet and began pawing the air.
It fixed its beady eyes on the face of Tommy
Thompson. Tommy uttered a little cry and
shrank back.
</p>
<p>
“He lika da littla girl,” grinned the Italian.
</p>
<p>
“Never mind being personal. If you will
keep your distance we will pay you a quarter
to see the bear dance.” Miss Elting drew a
coin from her pocket, and stepping forward,
without the least hesitation, handed it to the
man with the pole. “Keep him over on that
side of the fire. You two men remain over there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>
also. Remember, we are quite well prepared
to assert our rights if you do not do as you
are told. Watch that neither of them gets into
the tent, Harriet,” she added in a whisper.
</p>
<p>
Harriet Burrell nodded understandingly. The
bear, in response to frequent prods of the pole,
ambled about, dancing awkwardly, now and
then uttering a growl of resentment at the
treatment he was receiving. His master put
the animal through its paces. At this juncture,
Jane McCarthy, who, some time before, had
driven off to a farm house in quest of milk for
breakfast, drove in with a great rattle and honking.
At first the Italians were for dragging
their bear away. But, upon discovering that
the newcomer was only another young woman,
they grinned and went on with the performance.
</p>
<p>
“Hello! what have we here?” cried Jane.
“Where did you catch that beast? Hey, you
men! Didn’t I pass you on the road this afternoon?
Yes, I did. I recognize your friend,
the bear. Better look out for those fellows. I
don’t like the looks of them,” declared Crazy
Jane to Miss Elting in a low voice. “I’d a
heap sooner trust the bear than the men, and
I wouldn’t care to turn my back on either for
very long at one time.” Then turning to the
men she said: “Make your bear do his tricks
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>
over again. I haven’t seen the show, you
know.”
</p>
<p>
“Twent-five cent,” answered the man.
</p>
<p>
Jane looked at him for a few seconds, then,
throwing back her head, laughed loudly.
</p>
<p>
“Twent-five cents, eh? I guess not! Does
he dance, or does he not?” she demanded.
</p>
<p>
For answer the man with the pole gave the
bear a vicious poke, the other led the animal
to a small tree, to which he tied him.
</p>
<p>
“My gracious, are they going to camp here?”
gasped Margery.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t be afraid. We will send them on
their way soon enough,” answered Harriet in
a low voice. “I wouldn’t make them angry,
Miss Elting.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t intend to.”
</p>
<p>
“Leave them to me. See here, men, what
do you propose to do now?” demanded Jane
briskly.
</p>
<p>
“We lika somathing to eat.”
</p>
<p>
“All right. You shall have somathing.
Twent-five cent please,” mimicked Crazy Jane,
holding out a hand. She was so droll about it
that the girls burst out laughing.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, you shouldn’t have done that. See,
you have made them angry,” whispered Hazel.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t care if I have. I’ll be getting angry
myself, pretty soon—maybe.”

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span></div>
<p>
“Shall I get something for them, Miss Elting?”
questioned Harriet.
</p>
<p>
The guardian nodded. Harriet ran into the
tent, where she quickly prepared some roast
beef sandwiches. These she carried out and
handed to the leader of the bear. He divided
with his companion. The two men sat down
by the fire and began eating voraciously.
</p>
<p>
“You gotta coffee?” asked the leader, his
mouth so full of the sandwich he was eating
that he was barely understandable.
</p>
<p>
“No. We have no coffee made,” replied Miss
Elting. “You will have to get along with what
you have.”
</p>
<p>
“You maka coffee. You maka now!”
</p>
<p>
“What?” cried Crazy Jane belligerently.
“You order us to make coffee for you, you lazy
good-for-nothings? Get out of here before I
lose my temper with you.”
</p>
<p>
“Easy, Jane!” warned Miss Elting.
</p>
<p>
“You no giva coffee, I letta out da bear,”
threatened the leader, scrambling up and running
to the tree where the cinnamon bear was
secured. The second Italian also had risen to
his feet. He was edging toward the rear of the
tent, evidently thinking that he was not observed.
But Harriet, though not appearing to
notice, was watching him narrowly. Tommy
and Margery were trembling with fear. Harriet and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>
Jane were unafraid. They were getting
a little angry, however. Miss Elting
slipped into the tent and getting her revolver,
secreted it in a fold of her skirt. Just as she
emerged the second Italian ducked in under the
edge of the tent. The tent had been staked
down firmly and as the man was somewhat
stout he stuck when half way under the side
wall.
</p>
<p>
“Come out of that,” commanded Harriet.
</p>
<p>
Instead of obeying her the man tried to wriggle
in.
</p>
<p>
“I see I’ve got to attack him from inside the
tent,” decided the girl. Wheeling about she ran
into the tent where, in the light from the campfire,
she could see the tousled head and rolling
black eyes of the man underneath the side wall.
Without speaking she seized a pail of water that
stood near the entrance of the tent and dashed
it full into the man’s face.
</p>
<p>
“Hurrah for Harriet!” cried Crazy Jane
from the tent door, where she stood waving her
arms now and hopping about gleefully.
</p>
<p>
Choking and sputtering the man wriggled
out from under the tent uttering a perfect torrent
of abuse in his native tongue. It was about
this time that Miss Elting discovered that she
had forgotten to load the revolver before taking
it from the tent. Meanwhile the leader had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span>
untied the chain of the bear and was urging it
forward, evidently intending to frighten the
women.
</p>
<p>
“You giva me mon. I then-a go way with da
bear. You giva me mon,” he demanded angrily.
</p>
<p>
Tommy Thompson, at this juncture, found
her courage. Snatching up a burning fire
brand she charged the man leading the bear.
He leaped back to avoid the thrust of the fiery
club. The bear swung a giant paw at her.
Tommy hit him over the nose with the firebrand.
In the meantime Hazel Holland, following
Harriet’s example, appeared on the scene with
another pail of water, which she dashed over
the leader and the bear.
</p>
<p>
Fire and water were a little more than the
man or the bear had bargained for, so they
made haste to get out of the danger zone.
Crazy Jane, in the meantime pursued them
shouting and brandishing a stout stick that she
had picked up in the field. Jane chased the men
all the way to the road, with Tommy and her
fiery club in close pursuit.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, those rascals!” cried the guardian,
when the girls returned. “And that miserable
bear! I’ll warrant the three of them got the
fright of their lives. They won’t bother the
Meadow-Brook Girls soon again.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span>
</p>
<p>
“I am not so certain of that,” answered Harriet,
smiling. “We did give them a scare,
though. But I’m sorry I had almost to drown
that one man. He was determined to get into
the tent. What do you suppose he wanted?”
</p>
<p>
“To steal something, of course,” answered
Miss Elting.
</p>
<p>
“And Tommy. Did you see Tommy and her
torch, girls? Oh, wasn’t it a sight?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. And Hazel and Harriet with their
pails of water,” chuckled the guardian.
</p>
<p>
“Tommy, dear,” exclaimed Miss Elting, as
the little girl sat down beside her, flushed and
triumphant. “You have earned a bead this
evening. I think each one of you is entitled
to a bright red bead. Now pile on the wood,
girls, so we shall have plenty of light. I don’t
apprehend further trouble, but it is well to be
prepared.”
</p>
<p>
“I will see to that,” spoke up Harriet. “I
have a plan that will make it unnecessary for
any one to sit up and keep watch.”
</p>
<p>
Harriet explained her plan, which met with
the approval of the others. That plan was
destined to fulfill its purpose later in the night,
for their excitement was not yet ended, and before
the dawning of another day, the Meadow-Brook
Girls were once more to distinguish
themselves.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span><a name='chVII' id='chVII'></a>CHAPTER VII—DISCOVERING MIDNIGHT PROWLERS</h2>
<p>
“Have you a ball of strong twine in your
kit, Jane?” asked Harriet. “You
told me to ask for anything I wanted
but did not see.”
</p>
<p>
“Sure, I have. In the tool box. Wait. I’ll
get it for you.”
</p>
<p>
While Jane went for the twine, Harriet hurried
out, returning a few moments later with
two sticks, each stick being about five feet long.
Next she got a tin pail and stood the pail bottom-side-up
on the sticks. Her companions
watched her wonderingly.
</p>
<p>
“What <em>are</em> you trying to do?” demanded
Miss Elting.
</p>
<p>
“Fixing a burglar alarm. You’ll agree that
it is all right after I have it finished. Now, I
want to run this twine all the way around the
camp. I shall need some round sticks. Help
me find some, Tommy. You have sharp
eyes.”
</p>
<p>
All hands set out to hunt for the desired
sticks. Harriet began thrusting them into the
soft ground at more or less regular intervals.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>
</p>
<p>
When the stakes had been placed loops of
string were tied near the tops of them, and
through these loops was threaded the long twine
until the camp was entirely surrounded by it. It
formed a thread-like barrier that seemed too
slender a thing to be of much use. One end of
the string was secured to the two sticks on which
the pail had been placed. The slack in the
string was taken up until the sticks and the
pail tilted from the wall of the tent at a sharp
angle.
</p>
<p>
“Hurrah!” cried the guardian. “That is a
most ingenious contrivance. How did you come
to think of it?”
</p>
<p>
“Nethethity ith the mother of invention, tho
my father thayth,” spoke up Grace.
</p>
<p>
Harriet nodded approvingly. The others
laughed.
</p>
<p>
“Tommy is becoming quite a philosopher,”
averred the guardian. “Aren’t you going to
give us a demonstration of your invention, Harriet?”
</p>
<p>
“Very well,” laughed Harriet. “Hazel, will
you go out and stumble against the string?
Don’t you dare to break it for—Oh!”
</p>
<p>
The two sticks had come down with a crash,
the tin pail rattling as it rolled over the floor.
Tommy screamed and so did Margery.
</p>
<p>
“There’s your demonstration,” announced
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>
Harriet. “Some one is coming. I hope it isn’t
those Italians again.”
</p>
<p>
Miss Elting with her loaded revolver, Jane
with her club, Harriet armed this time with a
stout stick, sauntered forth to meet the newcomer.
Jane had run to the dark side of the
tent, thrusting her club across the corner ready
to use it at the first indication of trouble. To
her disgust, the farmer from whom she had
obtained permission to make camp, now appeared
on the scene.
</p>
<p>
“It’s all right, girls. This is the gentleman
who let us make camp here,” called Jane.
</p>
<p>
“I just came over to tell you to take care of
your fire. If it runs it’ll burn off the meadow,
it being all fresh seeding there. I wouldn’t
want to lose it,” hailed their visitor.
</p>
<p>
“Thank you for calling our attention to it.
We are always careful of fire,” Miss Elting
made reply.
</p>
<p>
“What was it I fell over when I came in
here?” he asked, glancing about him. “You
certainly look mighty comfortable here.”
</p>
<p>
The girls looked at each other and giggled.
</p>
<p>
“It was a little contrivance of one of our
young women, so that we might be warned of
the approach of strangers,” the guardian informed
him. “You see, it warned us that some
one was coming.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span>
</p>
<p>
“I guess you can take care of yourselves,
all right. Is there anything you want? If there
is, come over to the house. My wife is curious
to see this outfit. Maybe she will come over in
the morning.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you very kindly for your interest,”
answered the guardian. “We shall be breaking
camp early in the morning.”
</p>
<p>
The farmer left. Harriet nodded to her companions.
</p>
<p>
“Was the demonstration satisfactory?” she
questioned.
</p>
<p>
“I should say it was,” answered Margery.
“It nearly scared me out of my wits.”
</p>
<p>
“I suppose we shall have to mend the string
now. The farmer’s big boots broke it in two
places. However, we needn’t worry about any
person getting into this camp to-night without
giving us warning of his approach,” said Harriet.
She repaired the broken “burglar alarm,”
then returning to the tent adjusted the sticks
and the pail, placing several other pieces of
tinware with it. The girls then gathered about
the campfire, where they chatted, told stories
and exchanged experiences until a late hour.
</p>
<p>
Harriet got out the map just before they retired.
After consulting with Miss Elting for
some time, it was decided that they should take
a short cut across a rugged country, using their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>
compass to guide them, meeting Jane some
twelve miles further on. She would have to
drive more than twenty miles to make the point.
The girls did not enjoy the highways very
much. In the first place, the roads were dusty;
many curious people were to be met with on
the roads; then again they thoroughly enjoyed
breaking new paths through the forests and
over fields and hills. Now that all the crops
had been garnered there was no danger of doing
damage to the farmers’ fields by tramping
across them. Jane was instructed to wait for
them after driving into the next town for fresh
supplies.
</p>
<p>
“It’s curious that we don’t run across any
melon fields. The first one I catch sight of I’m
going to raid,” she declared.
</p>
<p>
“No, Jane, you mustn’t do that,” objected
the guardian. “What we get we must pay
for.”
</p>
<p>
“Certainly,” agreed Jane. “But there isn’t
any sport in just walking up and paying for
melons. It’s a heap more fun to forage for
them.”
</p>
<p>
“But, Jane, think what it means to take an
object of value that doesn’t belong to you. It
is stealing!”
</p>
<p>
“That’s true. It surely is,” agreed Jane.
“I won’t ever mention any such thing again.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>
</p>
<p>
“Thank you,” returned Miss Elting with a
smile that amply repaid Crazy Jane for her
decision.
</p>
<p>
At last all hands began making preparations
for bed. Folding cots were opened and made
up, fresh fuel was heaped on the campfire,
then Harriet and Miss Elting made a round of
the camp to see that all was in shape for the
night. Jane lighted the big headlights on her
car, turning them on the darkest part of the
camp, after which they drew the flap to the tent
and began preparing for bed. Half an hour
later the camp was silent, save for the occasional
crackling of the fire. All the dead leaves
and inflammable stuff had been raked away and
the ground dug up immediately about the fire
to prevent it from spreading. The moon now
silvered the landscape, and a faint mist was
rising from about the Willow Ponds, adding to
the beauty of the night.
</p>
<p>
Midnight came, then the silence became more
marked than before. About one o’clock in the
morning two men might have been observed
skulking about the farther side of the pond
nearest to the camp. They took care not to
come within range of the headlights of Crazy
Jane’s motor car. Had one looked closely at
them the men might have been recognized as
the same pair that had visited the camp with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span>
the bear earlier in the evening. What their
purpose was in returning could only be surmised.
</p>
<p>
It might be revenge or robbery. In either
event it was bad enough, and the Meadow-Brook
Girls, sleeping soundly, were blissfully unconscious
of the danger that menaced them. Their
faith in Harriet Burrell’s burglar alarm permitted
them to sleep without fear.
</p>
<p>
All at once there was a mighty crash in the
tent. As Tommy Thompson described it afterwards,
“it thounded ath if lightning had thtruck
a tin thhop.” The tin pail and the other kitchen
utensils that had been hung on the long sticks
in the tent came down with a clatter and a bang.
The tin pail rolled clear across the tent, landed
on Margery Brown, bringing from her a scream
of terror.
</p>
<p>
“Quick! Put on your bathrobes!” called
Miss Elting. “There is trouble here.”
</p>
<p>
No need to tell them that. The tin pail already
had conveyed this information to the
Meadow-Brook Girls.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, thave me!” wailed Tommy.
</p>
<p>
Harriet was the first one to run outside the
tent.
</p>
<p>
“There they are!” she cried, having caught
sight of two skulking figures near the automobile.
“It’s the same Italians. Let’s call for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>
help as loudly as we can. Perhaps that will
make them take to their heels.”
</p>
<p>
It had the desired effect. Seeing that the
camp was fully aroused the intruders fled. Then
a daring plan suggested itself to Crazy Jane
McCarthy. Leaving her companions she started
on a run for her car.
</p>
<p>
“Come back! Where are you going?” cried
the guardian.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll show you, I’ll show them! Just watch
and you’ll see more fun than a barrel of monkeys
eating cayenne pepper.”
</p>
<p>
Dashing up to the car, she advanced the spark
control, and gave the crank a quick turn. The
car began a sputtering that quickly grew into
a roar from the exhaust. Crazy Jane leaped
in. She was clad in a bathrobe that reached to
her ankles; her tangle of hair fell about her face
and shoulders giving her face a wilder and more
weird expression than ever.
</p>
<p>
Jane threw in the high speed lever. The
car leaped forward. Harriet Burrell, who had
divined something of Jane’s purpose, made a
running leap and landed on the step, grasping
one of the cover braces for support.
</p>
<p>
“Jane, Jane! For goodness’ sake, what are
you going to do?”
</p>
<p>
“I’m going to give the rascals the scare of
their lives. They haven’t had enough. Get in!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span>
</p>
<p>
Harriet did so, but only to prevent being
thrown off the car. She had little desire to participate
in the drive that she well knew would
be an exciting one. Miss Elting was shouting
to Jane to come back. Jane did not or would
not hear. Uttering a shrill little cry of triumph
she drove the car ahead at a perilous
rate of speed. Over the rough field the automobile
lurched and careened imperiling the
safety of its occupants and threatening momentarily
to upset and wreck the car.
</p>
<p>
The two men were fleeing across the field.
Seeing the car bearing down upon them, they
began to dodge. The big white eyes of the
headlights followed them wherever they went.
It was maddening. Now the fugitives began
zig-zagging. So did Crazy Jane. Once she
nearly ran them down. The Italians sprang
out of the way just in time and began running
back toward the camp. Jane pursued them as
soon as she could get the car turned about and
facing the other way. By this time the men
had gotten a long start.
</p>
<p>
“They’re making for the camp, the villains,”
breathed Jane.
</p>
<p>
“It is because they are trying to get out of
your way,” answered Harriet almost breathlessly.
“You will have to head them off.”
</p>
<p>
“Head them off nothing!” exploded Jane.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>
“Rather will I take their heads off, the miserable
rascals.”
</p>
<p>
“Jane, Jane! You mustn’t run them down.
You simply <em>must not</em>. You might kill them.
Please, please don’t try to do that, dear!”
begged Harriet.
</p>
<p>
“All right, darlin’. But you’re making me
lose a lot of fun. I don’t get an opportunity
like this every day in the week. They deserve
all I can give them.”
</p>
<p>
“You mustn’t harm a human being, no matter
how bad he is. There, they have turned toward
the road.”
</p>
<p>
“I won’t hurt them,” promised Jane. “I’ll
just scare them a little.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” cried Harriet as the car rose on two
wheels, nearly turning over. “Do be careful!”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t be afraid. As long as I’ve got two
wheels on the ground I’m all right. Now if
I had only one wheel on the old sod you might
worry, but you wouldn’t worry for long. See
’em go. They know I’ve got them now!”
</p>
<p>
Just then the men plunged headlong into a
ditch that extended all the way across the field.
The girls had not discovered it until that moment.
Jane checked her car just in time to prevent
it also from going into the ditch.
</p>
<p>
“There’s a bridge to the right,” Harriet informed
her, then was sorry she had made the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span>
suggestion. Crazy Jane charged the bridge at
full speed. All four wheels seemed to strike
the planking at the same instant.
</p>
<p>
Jane turned sharply. They were now chasing
the two men obliquely across the field. The
men were lagging.
</p>
<p>
“They’re getting winded,” shouted Crazy
Jane triumphantly.
</p>
<p>
“Please go back now,” begged Harriet
“You have frightened them enough. They
never will trouble us again.”
</p>
<p>
“Not till I get the wretches on a run down
the road. I’ve not finished with them yet.”
</p>
<p>
“They have nearly finished themselves,” answered
Harriet. She was no longer apprehensive
that Jane would injure the men intentionally,
though Harriet feared that one of them
might stumble and be crushed underneath the
car. Still her pulses were beating high, the
color in her cheeks had mounted to her forehead.
She was entering into the spirit of the wild
chase almost with the enthusiasm of Crazy Jane
herself.
</p>
<p>
The voices of their companions in the camp
no longer reached them. The two girls were
too far away to hear now, even had the car not
been making such a din.
</p>
<p>
The two men were making for the roadside
fence, a board structure, which in the haze of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span>
the damp night, the girls did not see. They had
forgotten that the fence was there.
</p>
<p>
All at once the men reached the fence. Grasping
the top board they flung themselves over,
landing heavily on the ground on the other side.
</p>
<p>
“Look out!” cried Harriet warningly.
</p>
<p>
“Hold fast!” yelled Jane.
</p>
<p>
Crash!
</p>
<p>
The car struck the fence with a mighty crash
accompanied by the sound of splintering woodwork.
The headlights went out, and Jane
brought her car to a stop in the midst of the
wreck at the roadside.
</p>
<h2><a name='chVIII' id='chVIII'></a>CHAPTER VIII—CAUGHT IN A MORASS</h2>
<p>
“Well, here we are,” announced Crazy
Jane calmly.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, see those fellows run!”
cried Harriet, gaspingly. “There they go!”
she cried, in almost hysterical amusement, after
she had picked herself up from the bottom of
the car, where the collision had hurled her.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve a good notion to send the car straight
through the fence, and chase that pair of
skulkers out of the state!” Jane McCarthy proposed
vindictively.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span>
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you try to do it,” protested Harriet,
now sobered by the realization of how reckless
her companion might easily become. “Jane,
<em>some day</em> you’ll really hit some one—that would
be awful!”
</p>
<p>
“But I didn’t half frighten that pair of rascals,”
returned Jane.
</p>
<p>
“If the men weren’t frightened, then they’ll
never know fear,” insisted Harriet Burrell.
“How badly is the car damaged?”
</p>
<p>
“A blow on the nose, but the nose is not even
out of joint,” Jane answered coolly.
</p>
<p>
“Then let us get back to Miss Elting. How
she’ll scold!”
</p>
<p>
Miss Elting did scold when they reached camp
with the car. It is to be feared, however, that
Jane heard but little of the rebuke, for she was
busy examining the damage done to her beloved
car. She found that she could put the lamps in
condition again. The guard rod in front of the
radiator was also injured. Jane decided that
this could be easily fixed.
</p>
<p>
“Girls, girls! What do you mean by such
actions. Jane, I am amazed at you. Harriet,
how could you?” Miss Elting rebuked them
roundly.
</p>
<p>
“I—I guess it was impulse,” answered Harriet,
her face crimsoning under the reproachful
words of the guardian. “Please don’t scold
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>
us. We drove the men off. They will not
trouble us again, I am quite sure.”
</p>
<p>
“But they might have been run down, girls.”
</p>
<p>
“Served them right if they had, bad luck to
them!” retorted Jane mischievously. “However,
’all’s well that ends well.’ I’m for bed.
What do you say?”
</p>
<p>
“Thay, why didn’t you take me along?” demanded
Tommy.
</p>
<p>
“It was quite bad enough without your assistance,”
replied the guardian. “Yes, we had
better retire at once. Do you wish to put up
your burglar alarm again, Harriet?”
</p>
<p>
“I do not think it will be necessary. The
men won’t prowl about the camp again to-night.”
</p>
<p>
“No, they won’t,” agreed Jane, laughing uproariously.
“They’re running yet and they’ll
be running as long as their wind holds out. I
wonder where they left the bear? Wouldn’t it
be fun if we could find the bear and let him
loose?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh-h-h!” cried Margery. “How can you
talk so, Jane?”
</p>
<p>
“Most certainly not,” rebuked Miss Elting.
“You have done quite enough as it is, without
turning a bear loose on the community. You had
better all go back to bed. What did you do to
your car, Jane?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>
</p>
<p>
“Bumped its nose, that’s all. My only regret
is that I didn’t bump it against one of the
Italians. I shouldn’t have minded giving the
bear a smash, too. Good night. Sweet dreams,
darlin’s!” Jane flounced into the tent and
throwing off her bathrobe tumbled into bed,
where she was soon sound asleep. The others
did not quiet down quite so quickly. Harriet,
especially, lay thinking over the experiences of
the evening, and each time the thought of the
pursuit of the Italians by Crazy Jane and her
motor car occurred to her, Harriet would laugh
softly to herself. She finally laughed herself
to sleep, to be awakened in what seemed but a
few moments later, by the blowing of a fish horn
at the lips of Crazy Jane McCarthy. Day had
dawned. The sun was just peeping over the
eastern hills, the campfire was blazing and Miss
Elting was getting breakfast.
</p>
<p>
Harriet quickly drew on her bathing suit, then,
running out of the tent, plunged into the pond,
uttering a little scream as the cold water enveloped
her. None of the others had the courage
to take a cold plunge that morning, as the
air was rather cool. As for Harriet, she remained
in the pond until Miss Elting insisted
that she come ashore.
</p>
<p>
Camp was struck immediately after breakfast
as the girls wished to make as much progress on their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span>
journey in the cool of the morning
as possible. They struck camp with the skill
of veterans, and within half an hour from the
time they began the operation, everything was
packed and stowed in the car.
</p>
<p>
“Now, don’t you girls try to play me any more
tricks to-day. I’ve got the food. If you don’t
find Jane, you get no supper. Understand?”
laughed Jane.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve got thome bithcuit in my pack,” piped
Tommy.
</p>
<p>
“She won’t have them for long,” laughed
Margery. “Tommy will have eaten the biscuits
before she has gone a mile.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I don’t eat tho much that I get fat,”
protested Tommy. “I gueth I know when to
thtop.”
</p>
<p>
Miss Elting was giving Jane final directions
as to when and where to look for them, after
which the four girls and their guardian, with
their packs slung over their backs, stout sticks
in their hands to assist them over rough places
and also to frighten away troublesome dogs,
started out on their journey of ten miles or
more. They crossed the road, traveled up a
hill and headed straight across country. The
unmarked trail was rough and following it
fatigued them considerably during the first two
miles of their journey.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span>
</p>
<p>
Shortly after eleven o’clock they came in
sight of a remote farm house tucked away in
a valley. Miss Elting decided to call there to
get some milk. The woman of the house at
first regarded them with suspicion, but she soon
thawed under Miss Elting’s gentle voice and
winning smile.
</p>
<p>
The milk had not been skimmed. All the old
milk had been churned that day. There was
nothing left but buttermilk, the woman told
them.
</p>
<p>
“Buttermilk!” cried the girls in chorus.
</p>
<p>
“I jutht love buttermilk!” declared Tommy.
“Do you have buttermilk cowth? Ithn’t that
fine? I’m going to make my father buy me a
buttermilk cow.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I was going to feed that buttermilk
to the hogs, but seeing as you want it I suppose
you may have it,” decided the woman with
some reluctance. “Do you like it cold?”
</p>
<p>
The party answered in the affirmative. The
housewife lowered a pail of buttermilk into
the well to cool, the party sitting down under
an apple tree in the yard to rest themselves
in the meantime. Margery lay down and
went to sleep. Tommy amused herself by tickling
Buster’s ear with a long, dead stalk of
timothy grass. Margery in her sleep thought
it a fly. She fought the fly for some time, then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>
finally opening her eyes, she caught Tommy red
handed. Tommy fled into the farm house,
where she pretended to be much interested in
the housewife’s work. She soon won her way
into the good graces of the woman, and when,
finally, the little lisping girl emerged from the
house she was carrying a tin tray of food.
</p>
<p>
“Jutht thee what I’ve got,” she cried. “It
taketh Tommy Thompthon to get thingth to
eat.”
</p>
<p>
There were sandwiches, ginger cookies—great
fat brown fellows—and a large dish of apple
sauce.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, girls!” cried Margery her eyes glistening
at the prospect of a feast. “I could die
eating that food.”
</p>
<p>
“Tommy, did you beg for this?” demanded
the guardian.
</p>
<p>
“I gueth not. I jutht athked for it,” returned
Tommy calmly. “When you want
thomething you want, jutht athk for it, and if
you don’t get it you haven’t wasted anything but
your breath.”
</p>
<p>
“Madam, we are very grateful to you for
this kindness, and will pay you before leaving,”
called Miss Elting to the housewife, who
came out at this juncture to draw up the bucket
of buttermilk from the cool depths of the well.
</p>
<p>
“You’re welcome, I’m sure. I just baked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span>
to-day. Hope the cookies are all right. They
didn’t rise to suit me.”
</p>
<p>
“They’d have burthted if they’d rithen any
more,” observed Tommy. She was rebuked by
a look from Harriet.
</p>
<p>
“I hope you like them,” smiled the woman.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, they are simply delicious,” answered
Harriet, with glowing eyes. “And that buttermilk!
I never drank any that tasted better.”
</p>
<p>
The party ate their fill of the good things,
Margery doing even more than her share in
disposing of both buttermilk and food. When
they had finished, the tray was empty. The
woman offered to bring them more food, but
Miss Elting said “no.” She gave the woman
fifty cents despite the protests of the latter;
then, after a brief rest, they started on again,
first having expressed their thanks to the housewife,
who stood in the door of her home watching
the little party until it had passed out of
sight.
</p>
<p>
About the middle of the afternoon the girls
halted for another rest because of Margery’s
complaints that she was feeling ill.
</p>
<p>
“You ate too much,” declared Harriet. “It
doesn’t do to eat so much when one is taking
exercise as we are.”
</p>
<p>
“Yeth. Buthter alwayth eatth too much,”
averred Tommy wisely.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” moaned Margery Brown, sitting down
all in a heap. “I can’t walk another step to-day.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you think we should leave her here?”
asked Harriet, with solemn face but twinkling
eyes.
</p>
<p>
“We shall see how she feels after I have
given her something to settle her stomach,” answered
Miss Elting gravely.
</p>
<p>
“No, no, no!” wailed Margery. “Don’t
leave me. I’ll go. Let me lie still and rest myself
a little first.”
</p>
<p>
“You thee Buthter, it doethn’t pay to be tho
greedy,” admonished Tommy.
</p>
<p>
“Will you please make her stop?” begged
Buster. “I can’t stand it.”
</p>
<p>
“Tommy!” rebuked Harriet. “Haven’t you
any consideration for Margery?”
</p>
<p>
“Yeth. Of courthe I have. But thhe doethn’t
detherve any thympathy.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m ashamed of you, Tommy, dear. Wait.
You, too, will be ill one of these days, then we
shall make unpleasant remarks to you,” warned
Harriet.
</p>
<p>
Grace Thompson flushed guiltily.
</p>
<p>
“That ith too bad, Buthter. I didn’t mean to
make you feel worthe. Honetht I didn’t. I
hope you will be better pretty thoon.” Tommy
kissed her. “There. Ithn’t that better?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” admitted Margery. She already had
taken some peppermint drops that Miss Elting
had administered. After a further rest the
girls assisted her to her feet and walked her
slowly up and down the road. She was then
permitted to sit down and rest again. Tommy,
an expression of concern on her impish face,
crouched before the now pale-faced Buster,
munching a hard biscuit.
</p>
<p>
“Come, girls,” said Miss Elting finally. “It
is nearly five o’clock. We were to meet Jane
at five, and we must have a good two hours’
walk ahead of us still. Now that Margery is
feeling so ill we shall not be able to make nearly
as good time as that. I wonder if we hadn’t
better find the highway and finish the day’s
tramp on that?”
</p>
<p>
Margery protested that they must not change
their plans on her account. She declared that
she could walk as well as any of them.
</p>
<p>
“Margery will repent her rash assertions before
she has gone a mile,” laughed Hazel.
</p>
<p>
“No. I think she will be all right, now,” replied
the guardian. “Margery, if you find that
you are feeling worse, at any time, you must
be sure to tell me at once. Now, girls, march!”
</p>
<p>
The little company plodded along. Harriet
linked one arm within Margery’s. The latter,
while feeling much improved, was still a little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span>
weak and Harriet Burrell’s sturdy arm was
appreciated.
</p>
<p>
About six o’clock they came to a long hill that
sloped gently down into a valley. The greater
part of the valley was covered with trees. It
appeared to be a dense forest of second growth,
the trees not being very large. The guardian
consulted the map.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. We are on the right trail. We must
keep straight on through the woods. According
to this map there should be a trail that leads
directly to the other side of the valley, and
when we reach that point we shall have finished
our day’s journey.”
</p>
<p>
“I am afraid we are going to be caught in
the dark, Miss Elting,” said Harriet.
</p>
<p>
“If we find the trail we do not need to worry
about that. We can’t very well go astray. I
would suggest that, when we get down farther
into the valley, we spread out and look for the
wood trail. The one who first discovers it will
shout. By taking this open formation we shall
be saving time. It certainly seems to me that
the distance to be covered to-day is more than
ten miles.”
</p>
<p>
“It does seem so,” agreed Hazel. “But we
have lost considerable time on the way.”
</p>
<p>
They began spreading out when about half
way down the hill, calling to each other good-naturedly,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span>
shouting as they got farther and
farther away. Tommy discovered the road.
She ran out into the field waving her arms and
crying shrilly to attract the attention of her
companions. They hurried toward her. The
road, as they soon learned, was a mere path and
one not much frequented at that, as was evidenced
by the vegetation that grew in the middle
of it.
</p>
<p>
“This looks to me like rather low swampy
land,” declared Harriet. “It is my idea that
we had better stick closely to the path, or we
may get into trouble.” She did not say definitely
what she feared, not wishing to needlessly
terrorize Margery and Tommy. Miss Elting
understood their danger, however. She nodded.
Harriet started along the trail, leading the way,
with the guardian following at her heels.
They went on in this way for half an hour. The
forest grew darker as they proceeded, the vegetation
being thick in there. The day was waning
rapidly. It was not very long before they
were groping their way, rather than finding it
by sight.
</p>
<p>
A scream from Margery, who was at the rear,
brought them up sharply. Then Tommy’s
voice was raised in a sharp cry of alarm.
</p>
<p>
“What is it?” shouted Harriet.
</p>
<p>
“I’m sinking!” screamed Margery.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span>
</p>
<p>
Harriet instantly knew the meaning of this.
Her worst fears were confirmed. They were in
the middle of a vast morass that stretched on
each side of the trail.
</p>
<p>
“Thave me! Oh, thave me!” wailed Tommy.
</p>
<p>
Both girls were in the mud, but just how
deeply Harriet Burrell did not know. Now
Hazel added her cries to those of Tommy and
Margery. She, too, had stepped off the path.
Harriet could hear Hazel floundering in the
mire. Miss Elting hurried back to them, regardless
of her own safety.
</p>
<p>
“Be careful!” called Harriet warningly,
groping her way to her companions who were
crying and screaming for help.
</p>
<h2><a name='chIX' id='chIX'></a>CHAPTER IX—THE TRAMP CLUB TO THE RESCUE</h2>
<p>
“Look out, Miss Elting,” warned Harriet
again. “The girls are in the mud.”
</p>
<p>
“So am I,” cried the guardian in a
voice of alarm. “Oh, it’s deep. I’m sinking.”
</p>
<p>
“Stand perfectly still,” advised Harriet.
“You will get in deeper if you struggle. I’ll see
what I can do. I may get in, too.”
</p>
<p>
“Be quick, Harriet,” urged the guardian.
“This is serious. I can’t move an inch.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span>
</p>
<p>
“I’ll do the best I can. Oh, I wish I had some
good sized limbs of trees to throw to you.
Here’s one. Where are you, Miss Elting?”
</p>
<p>
“Here. It’s no use. I can’t pull myself
out.”
</p>
<p>
Margery was screaming at the top of her
voice. It seemed as though her cries must be
heard throughout the woods. No amount of
urging could induce her to be quiet.
</p>
<p>
“Let her yell. Let her make all the noithe
she can. Maybe thomebody will hear her,”
wailed Tommy.
</p>
<p>
This was good logic. Miss Elting told Buster
to shout as loudly as she could. The other
girls now added their voices to Buster’s frantic
screams. Harriet was moving about as rapidly
as she dared, but she was unable to find any
limbs large enough to be of much use to Miss
Elting, who was nearest to the trail over which
they had come. Harriet tried another experiment.
Breaking down a sapling that grew beside
the path she thrust this toward the
guardian.
</p>
<p>
“Take hold of it,” she commanded. “Have
you got it, Miss Elting?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“Give way loosely when I pull. I may be
able to pull you out. Don’t resist at all.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s no use, Harriet!” announced the guardian, after
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span>
several minutes of the hardest sort
of work on Harriet’s part. “I am getting
deeper in the mud with every move I make.
You will have to think of something else.”
</p>
<p>
“Girls, stop your screaming for a moment,”
called Harriet. “Tell me how you are? Are
you sinking deeper into the mud or are you remaining
about the same?”
</p>
<p>
“Whenever I make the slightest movement I
sink in deeper. I’m keeping as still as possible,”
answered Hazel.
</p>
<p>
“I’m in almotht up to my waitht,” cried
Tommy. “I’m going to be buried alive. Oh,
thave me!”
</p>
<p>
“As long as you are able to scream like that
you are all right,” comforted Harriet. “When
you stop yelling I shall begin to believe you are
in real trouble.”
</p>
<p>
Harriet now set to work cutting down small
saplings with her hatchet. These she threw out
into the space between Miss Elting and the
three girls. They were close together, which
somewhat simplified the work. The Meadow-Brook
girl knew that it would take a quantity
of the small trees and limbs to support her
weight, but it was the only course she knew of
to follow. Fortunately for Harriet she was an
athletic girl, possessing great strength for one
of her age and build. Better still, she possessed a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span>
courage and will all her own. Then,
too, Harriet Burrell was one of those doggedly
determined persons who never know when they
are worsted. Her mind was working even
more rapidly than were her hands. She had
succeeded in piling up enough stuff to form a
slight support for the arms of her companions.
She now explained her plan to them.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t think I shall be able to get you out
of the morass without taking a long chance of
getting in myself,” she began.
</p>
<p>
“Oh-h-h-h!” cried the girls despairingly.
They had relied implicitly on Harriet’s resourceful
brain to find the means to release
them from their dangerous predicament.
</p>
<p>
“Wait until I have finished. You know that
I’m not afraid. You know better than to think
so,” soothed Harriet. “Don’t you see, if I
were to get caught in the mud, your last hope
would be gone? We might all perish here before
any one found us.”
</p>
<p>
“You are right as usual, Harriet,” said Miss
Elting. She was apparently calm. If she
were nervous no trace of it was discoverable in
her voice. “What do you propose to do?”
</p>
<p>
“I am going to pile some more stuff on what
I have already placed there. Each of you is to
throw out her arms and if possible lock hands
across the barrier. When one hand gets tired
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>
change to the other one. That will keep you
from sinking down much deeper. The saplings
should keep you up, though it will be a rather
severe strain on your arm.”
</p>
<p>
“What will you do, Harriet?” asked Miss
Elting.
</p>
<p>
“I am going for help.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, don’t leave uth!” wailed Grace.
</p>
<p>
“Harriet is right,” agreed Hazel. “It is the
only thing to do. But which way will you go?”
</p>
<p>
“I will go back the way we came. I believe
that if I am careful I shall be able to reach
solid ground without getting off the trail. A
short distance from here the ground rises somewhat
and is harder. Once I reach that I shall
be safe.”
</p>
<p>
“But, Harriet, where will you go for help?”
</p>
<p>
“I saw the top of some farm buildings to the
west of where we were just before we entered
this horrid place. I think it will be best for me
to hurry there. I ought to be back in a couple
of hours at the outside.”
</p>
<p>
“Two <em>hourth</em>!” mourned Tommy.
</p>
<p>
“That will be better than staying there all
night, won’t it?” demanded Harriet.
</p>
<p>
“I should say it will,” agreed Hazel.
</p>
<p>
“Then hurry, dear,” urged Miss Elting.
</p>
<p>
“Is any one of you in pain?” questioned Harriet.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span>
</p>
<p>
“I think not,” replied Miss Elting. “The
ground is too soft to hurt. That’s the worst
of it. If the ground weren’t so soft and sticky
we should be able to get out. Do you think you
could build a fire before you go, Harriet?”
</p>
<p>
“I wouldn’t dare to do so. Suppose it should
spread to the trees about you after I had gone?
There are cedars and small pine trees in here.
The foliage of these trees is like tinder.”
</p>
<p>
“You are right!” exclaimed the guardian.
“To build a fire would be the height of folly.
Hurry, please. We will be here when you come
back,” she added with a forced laugh.
</p>
<p>
“Be brave, girls. Remember, we are Meadow-Brook
Girls,” said Harriet, as with a shouted
“good-bye” she started back along the trail on
her mission. Both arms were outspread so
that she might be warned by touch when getting
too close to the sides of the trail.
</p>
<p>
“Girls,” began Miss Elting brightly, after
Harriet had left them. “Harriet reminded us
that we are Meadow-Brook Girls. Let’s show
that we are by giving the Meadow-Brook yell.
Now. One, two, three, go!”
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Meadow-Brook.&nbsp;&nbsp;Meadow-Brook.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rah,&nbsp;&nbsp;rah,&nbsp;&nbsp;rah!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meadow-Brook,&nbsp;&nbsp;Meadow-Brook,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sis,&nbsp;&nbsp;boom,&nbsp;&nbsp;ah-h-h!”<br />
</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span></div>
<p>
The girls’ voices grew stronger after the second
line. The voices of Miss Elting and Tommy
Thompson rose above those of the other two.
Some one laughed. It was Tommy. Her
laugh was a trifle hysterical, but it was a laugh,
and for the moment it relieved the strain somewhat.
Miss Elting gave them no time to think
about themselves.
</p>
<p>
“Girls. Forty-nine Blue Bottles now,” she
cried, then began the chant herself, the others
joining in promptly.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Forty-nine&nbsp;&nbsp;blue&nbsp;&nbsp;bottles&nbsp;&nbsp;were&nbsp;&nbsp;hanging&nbsp;&nbsp;on&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;wall,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forty-nine&nbsp;&nbsp;blue&nbsp;&nbsp;bottles&nbsp;&nbsp;were&nbsp;&nbsp;hanging&nbsp;&nbsp;on&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;wall.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take&nbsp;&nbsp;one&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;bottles&nbsp;&nbsp;down&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;there’ll&nbsp;&nbsp;be&nbsp;&nbsp;forty-eight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blue&nbsp;&nbsp;bottles&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;hanging&nbsp;&nbsp;on&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;wall,&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;hanging&nbsp;&nbsp;on&nbsp;&nbsp;the<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wall.”<br />
</p>
<p>
They continued to chant regardless of aching
throats and hoarse voices, until every one of
those offending blue bottles had been removed
from the wall.
</p>
<p>
“Now the Meadow-Brook yell again. It will
bring assistance to us if any one hears it,” reminded
the guardian. They repeated the yell.
</p>
<p>
“Gracious!” cried Miss Elting.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, what is it now?” begged Margery, in
a frightened voice.
</p>
<p>
“Why, some malicious person has put all
those forty-nine blue bottles back on the wall
again. What shall we do?”

</p>
<p>
“I gueth we’ll have to take them off,” lisped
Tommy, amid laughter from her companions
and the guardian as well.
</p>
<p>
“I can’t,” moaned Margery. She began to
choke and cough. “I’ve swallowed a bug.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, the poor bug. I’m tho thorry for him,”
piped Tommy.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe we can catch him in one of those
bottles,” suggested Miss Elting. “Come, girls,
you aren’t going to desert me now, are you?
Already! ‘Forty-nine blue bottles were hanging on the wall.’”
</p>
<p>
Once more the girls went over the familiar refrain,
ending finally with the Meadow-Brook
yell. Again and again did they take the bottles
from the wall, but as often as they removed
them invisible hands replaced every one of the
forty-nine blue bottles in their accustomed position
on the wall.
</p>
<p>
For the tenth time the forty-nine blue bottles
had been taken down and hung up again. The
voices of the girls were so hoarse that they
could barely speak aloud, though they were
laughing hysterically as they labored with the
forty-ninth. They had almost forgotten that
they were in danger, forgotten their aching
bodies, forgotten that Harriet Burrell was
speeding through the darkness in quest of assistance,
when a distant but familiar cry
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span>
reached their ears. It was the long drawn out
“hoo-e-e-e-e” of the Meadow-Brook Girls.
</p>
<p>
Miss Elting heard it first. Her companions
were laughing so immoderately that they failed
to hear it the first time. The guardian’s voice
failed her. A lump rose in her throat. The
strain had been so great that several times she
found herself on the point of giving way. Now
the reaction had set in.
</p>
<p>
“Hoo-e-e-e-e!”
</p>
<p>
Tommy heard it, and uttered a scream. The
call was repeated. This time all the girls heard
it plainly.
</p>
<p>
“It’s Harriet, it’s Harriet!” cried Hazel.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. Rescue is at hand,” replied Miss Elting
fervently.
</p>
<p>
A light twinkled far away through between
the trees. It seemed to the anxious eyes of
the guardian as though it were miles and miles
distant. She raised her voice in a shout, but
the voice was so weak that it carried but a short
distance.
</p>
<p>
“Shout, girls!” she begged. “You may be
able to make them hear. I can’t. My voice has
completely left me. Tommy! You can always
scream. Do so now.”
</p>
<p>
Tommy let loose a thrilling, penetrating yell.
The rescue party heard it. They answered with
return shouts in male voices.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>
</p>
<p>
“That sounds to me like boys’ voices,” cried
Miss Elting huskily.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, thave me!” wailed Tommy. “My hair
ith all tumbled down, my frock ith muddy from
top to bottom and my fathe ith thmudged. I’m
a thight, I know I am. I can’t retheive company
to-day. Thend them away, pleathe.”
</p>
<p>
Some one came running toward them considerably
in advance of the light.
</p>
<p>
“Girls! Girls!” shouted an anxious voice.
</p>
<p>
“Here!” cried the guardian.
</p>
<p>
“Thank goodness you’re alive,” answered
Harriet Burrell. “I’ve been terribly anxious
about you. Here—here’s a can of fresh water.
I know your throats must be dry.”
</p>
<p>
Reaching forward, Harriet handed the can to
the guardian. Miss Elting passed it on to
Tommy. Each of the girls drank.
</p>
<p>
“Where are you, folks?” shouted a boyish
voice.
</p>
<p>
“Here. Just ahead of you,” answered Harriet.
She had sunk down on the trail, her
strength gone. A moment later she was on
her feet again, hurrying down the trail to guide
the rescuers to the spot.
</p>
<p>
A tall young fellow clad in khaki, a campaign
hat on his head, rushed up. Behind him came
half a dozen other young men similarly clad.
They were bearing fence rails on their shoulders, fairly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span>
staggering under the weight of their
burdens.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I’m so glad!” cried Miss Elting, now
on the verge of tears after the strain. “Who
are they, Harriet, my brave girl?”
</p>
<p>
“We’re the Tramp Club,” answered the
first boy. “We’ll introduce ourselves after we
get you girls out of the morass. You’re in a
fine mess and you certainly do need help.”
</p>
<h2><a name='chX' id='chX'></a>CHAPTER X—IN THE HANDS OF THE RESCUERS</h2>
<p>
“Now, keep perfectly quiet. Don’t move
an inch. We’ll have you out of it in
a few moments. Here, Dill, give me
the rope. Now the end of a rail. The young
lady over there with the flaxen hair——”
</p>
<p>
“It ithn’t flaxen. It ith blonde,” protested
Tommy indignantly.
</p>
<p>
“I stand corrected,” laughed the young man.
“Please grab the rope and pull on it. I don’t
dare throw a rail out there for fear of hitting
one of you. Being the farthest out, you will
be able to pull the rail right up to you. Never
mind if you do settle down an inch or two. I’ll
have you out at any rate. Do you understand?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yeth.”
</p>
<p>
“Then here goes.” The boy tossed a coil of
rope so accurately that the coil dropped directly
over Grace Thompson’s head. She uttered
a little scream as the rope slipped over
her head, then clawed frantically at it. “That’s
right,” cried her rescuer. “Now pull.”
</p>
<p>
Tommy pulled desperately drawing the rail
towards her, but sinking deeper and deeper into
the mud until she was nearly up to her armpits.
The little lisping girl took fresh alarm.
She began to cry, “Thave me!”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t be frightened. Here’s another rail!”
encouraged the youth. “We’ve got to build up
a bridge. Those limbs and saplings you have
out there will make an excellent foundation.
Hurry them up here, Dill! The young ladies
will grow impatient and refuse to wait for us
longer.”
</p>
<p>
The girls declined to laugh at this pleasantry.
They were in too much distress. Harriet stood
holding a lantern above her head so that the
boys might see to work to the best advantage.
The rails were drawn out by Tommy in each
instance, assisted by the girls between herself
and the path. Then the leader set his boys at
work felling the largest trees they could find
along the trail. The lads went at their work
with a will. As soon as the trees and brush
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span>
were cut down they were carried over and
dumped in on the rail and brush foundation,
forming a rude bridge. The leader then advanced
cautiously over it until he reached a
point near to the guardian and the girls.
</p>
<p>
“Now we will see what we can do.”
</p>
<p>
A rope was passed about the waist of the
guardian despite her protests that the others
should be gotten out of the morass first. Three
boys were put at the shore end of the rope with
orders to pull when their leader gave the word.
He, on his part, took firm hold of Miss Elting
under the arms, then shouted “now!”
</p>
<p>
Those on shore began to pull. The leader,
at the same time, began to lift with all his might,
moving the guardian’s shoulders from left to
right.
</p>
<p>
“Tell me if the rope hurts you,” gasped the
muscular young fellow.
</p>
<p>
Miss Elting came up so suddenly that her
rescuer fell over, narrowly escaping a plunge
into the morass. The guardian was finally
dragged to the path. The rescuers then turned
their attention to the other girls. Their wooden
raft was slowly sinking under the weight that
had been put upon it, but fresh stuff was being
constantly piled on it to keep it above the mud.
One by one the Meadow-Brook Girls were
hauled out.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>
</p>
<p>
Harriet had helped Miss Elting aside into the
shadows, where she assisted the guardian in
scraping the mud from her clothing. At first
Miss Elting was barely able to stand. She
found herself trembling from head to foot now
that the strain, mental and physical, was removed.
</p>
<p>
“Here’s another one!” cried the cheery
voice of the leader
</p>
<p>
“What wonderful boys!” breathed Miss Elting,
starting to go to Tommy’s assistance.
</p>
<p>
“Please lie down on the ground and rest,
Miss Elting. Don’t try to get up until we are
ready to start. I can take care of the others
as they are dragged out,” directed Harriet.
</p>
<p>
She assisted Tommy to a place beside Miss
Elting, the latter insisting upon trying to help
the unfortunate and humiliated Tommy in her
distressing condition.
</p>
<p>
“I withh I had thome clotheth fit to be
theen,” complained the little girl. “Thith dreth
ith a thight.”
</p>
<p>
“Be thankful that you are alive,” answered
Harriet sharply.
</p>
<p>
“We should have perished, had it not been
for you,” answered the guardian.
</p>
<p>
“Considering that I was the only one who
didn’t get into the mud, I simply had to be the
one to go for help. I don’t deserve any credit,”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>
flung back Harriet, hurrying over to assist the
suffering Buster. After Buster, came Hazel,
the last to be rescued.
</p>
<p>
“Have we got them all?” questioned the
young man.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, thank goodness,” answered Harriet.
</p>
<p>
“We are under great obligations to you,
young gentlemen. We are in no condition to
properly express our appreciation this evening.
I hope we may have an opportunity to do
so in the morning,” said Miss Elting.
</p>
<p>
“We are very glad to have been able to help
you. We needed a little exercise,” laughed the
young man. “Yes, we shall see you again, but
we haven’t finished our work yet. What do
you say? Shall we fix up some litters and carry
the young ladies out?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know. We shall see in a few moments.
Give them a chance to rest. They are
completely exhausted.”
</p>
<p>
“Certainly. We fellows are going on ahead
to examine this path. We'll return presently.”
</p>
<p>
The boys trudged off down the trail.
</p>
<p>
“We shan’t go far,” called back the leader,
then strode off after his companions. Harriet
and Miss Elting made the girls as comfortable
and presentable as possible, though it was apparent
that both girls and clothes needed a
thorough scrubbing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know how we are going to reach
camp,” pondered the guardian, while waiting
for Grace, Margery and Hazel to rest.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I forgot to tell you,” exclaimed Harriet;
“Jane met these boys this afternoon. Two
of them are acquaintances of hers. They are
high school boys from the town of Proctor.
Like ourselves they are out on a long tramp,
and they are camped right near where we are
to camp for the night. They assisted Jane to
put up the camp and get everything in order.
Then, when night came, Jane began to grow
worried. She declared that something had happened
to us. One of the boys wanted to know
which way we were to come and Jane told them.”
</p>
<p>
“‘Then they have gotten into the swamp and
they’re in trouble,’ declared one of the boys.
It seems that these boys passed through here
yesterday, and two of them got into the morass
in broad daylight. No wonder we floundered
into it trying to get through there in the dark.
Of course Jane was wild with anxiety. She
said they must help her find us. This they were
willing and glad to do. They decided to come
to this end of the swamp and begin their search
from the point where we were supposed to
have entered.”
</p>
<p>
“Did you meet them?” interrupted Miss Elting.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes. Jane rushed them, in her car, to the
nearest point on the road, then ran across the
field with them to the place where we took the
swamp trail. I met them just as I came out
into the field. Jane was wild with delight, then
she cried when I told her where you were. She
wanted to come here with me. I told her to
hurry back to camp and prepare hot water, get
everything ready, then come for us. She will
be back long before we get out of the swamp
I think. The boys told me all that I have told
you, as we were hurrying in here. It is very
fortunate for us that we met them,” declared
Harriet in a matter-of-fact tone.
</p>
<p>
“I think you are a very brave and resourceful
girl, Harriet. You will get some honor
beads for this. Girls, shall we sing ‘Forty-nine
Blue Bottles’ now?” questioned Miss Elting
quizzically.
</p>
<p>
“No!” shouted Tommy, so loudly that the
Tramp Club, who had gone a short distance
down the trail, heard and thought that the girls
were calling them back.
</p>
<p>
“Did you call us?” hailed the leader, running
back toward the girls.
</p>
<p>
“No,” returned Miss Elting. “We are all
right, thank you.”
</p>
<p>
The boys continued on down the trail. Half
an hour later they returned to find the girls
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>
somewhat rested and ready to proceed on their
journey.
</p>
<p>
“Do you think you feel strong enough to
go on?” asked the leader of the Tramp Club
solicitously.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” replied Miss Elting. “We are anxious
to meet Jane and get settled for the night.
You have not told us yet to whom we are indebted
for our rescue.”
</p>
<p>
“My name is George Baker. I’m the captain
of the Tramp Club. They’re a fine lot of
fellows, but full of mischief.”
</p>
<p>
“As I said before, we haven’t words with
which to express our gratitude to you for what
you have done for us,” said Miss Elting. “Ah!
There are your friends. Won’t you introduce
us to them? I’ll first introduce my Meadow-Brook
Girls.” Miss Elting introduced the girls
to the Tramp Club as a body, after which the
captain did the same with his friends. The
names of the members of the club as given by
the captain in his introduction, were Dill Dodd,
Fred Avery, Sam Crocker, Charles Mabie, Will
Burgess and Davy Dockrill.
</p>
<p>
“Taken altogether, ladies,” remarked the
captain, “we are a choice band of ruffians on
the road, though sometimes gentlemen when we
are at home.”
</p>
<p>
“I disagree with you,” laughed the guardian.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span>
“I shall never meet any finer gentlemen than
I have met to-night.”
</p>
<p>
The captain doffed his hat. Tommy was regarding
him out of the corners of her eyes.
She seemed about to say something; then, apparently
changing her mind, smiled impishly to
herself and remained silent.
</p>
<p>
“I told your friend, Miss McCarthy, to set
the boys at work getting things ready for the
ladies when they reached camp,” said the captain.
“My, but I got some thrills riding out
here with Miss McCarthy. We must have
driven out here at the rate of about a hundred
miles an hour. I never before rode so fast in
my life. Here, fellows, what’s the matter with
you! This is no marathon. The young ladies
can’t hit up that pace and keep on their feet.
Slow down.”
</p>
<p>
“We can walk jutht ath fatht ath any boy in
bootth,” retorted Tommy indignantly.
</p>
<p>
Captain Baker touched the rim of his hat.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll argue it out with you some other time,
Miss Thompson,” he said.
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” moaned Margery, staggering a little.
</p>
<p>
The head tramp immediately sprang to Margery’s
assistance. “Let me help you,” he insisted,
taking Margery by the arm. Miss Elting
stepped up on the other side of Margery,
taking the latter’s free arm.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span>
</p>
<p>
“Now, you will be all right, dear,” encouraged
the guardian.
</p>
<p>
Harriet, in the meantime, was assisting
Tommy along. The boys ahead began to sing.
In this way the party followed the trail out to
the field. The girls breathed sighs of relief as
they emerged into the open.
</p>
<p>
Just then, out of the darkness, rushed a figure,
throwing itself upon Tommy and Harriet.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, you dear girls!” cried Jane, flinging
an arm about the neck of each. “I nearly cried
my eyes out over you. But, when the boys
started out to find you, I knew it would be all
right. Everything is ready for you. Nice
warm baths, and there will be a pot of hot coffee
for you. I’ll whisk you to camp in short order.”
</p>
<p>
“Never mind the whisking,” spoke up the
guardian. “Captain Baker has told us about
your whisking him out here this evening.”
</p>
<p>
Jane threw back her head and laughed.
</p>
<p>
“How about going back? I’ll tell you what,
boys. I’ll take the girls and one of you, then
I’ll come back and get the rest.”
</p>
<p>
“No thank you, we will walk it,” answered
the chief tramp promptly.
</p>
<p>
“Never,” insisted Jane. “You come with
us, young man. I’ll be back here in half an
hour for the rest of these brave boys.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>
</p>
<p>
The captain declined to desert his men.
Jane therefore urged him no further. The
boys assisted in helping the Meadow-Brook
Girls into the car, then Jane drove away at a
rapid rate. She let the girls out at their camp,
located in a very pretty and now moonlit valley.
</p>
<p>
“You’ll find everything ready. I’m going
back for those unruly boys,” Jane announced,
turning her car about and racing back over the
road, her hair streaming over one shoulder,
her eyes sparkling with the excitement of it all.
The tramps had another lively ride to camp.
Jane did not spare them. She took an almost
savage delight in trying to frighten them, but
did not succeed very well in this attempt. If
they were afraid they failed to show it.
</p>
<p>
On reaching camp the tired wayfarers lost
no time in making for their tent where hot water
for their baths awaited them. By the time
Jane returned with the members of the Tramp
Club the Meadow-Brook Girls, clad in dry, fresh
clothing, were ready to receive their guests.
They presented a wholly different appearance,
now, and the boys gazed at them admiringly.
</p>
<p>
“Jane, the boys must join us at supper,” declared
Miss Elting.
</p>
<p>
George shook his head.
</p>
<p>
“There are too many of us. We’ll eat you
out of house and home.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>
</p>
<p>
“There’s lots more stuff to eat in the automobile,”
declared Jane hospitably. “You wait
till I unload the real supplies.”
</p>
<p>
She dragged out a hamper. It was filled with
good things to eat, and what particularly
pleased the boys, was the unexpected invitation
to eat with their new found friends.
</p>
<p>
Though the girls were tired and exhausted
from their trying experiences in the swamp, it
proved a happy evening. It was decided to
remain in camp all next day to rest. Strangely
enough Captain Baker announced that they too
had already concluded that they needed a rest.
He said they would do some foraging next day,
and bring the girls some good things to eat to
pay them back for what they had eaten and
for the exciting ride Jane had given them.
</p>
<p>
Miss Elting smiled knowingly. The tramps
appeared to be gentlemanly boys, however
“full of mischief” they might be.
</p>
<p>
It was ten o’clock when the Tramp Club said
good night and set out for their own camp.
</p>
<p>
“Now, children, go to bed at once,” directed
the guardian. “We have had excitement enough
for one day at least.”
</p>
<p>
The girls agreed with her, and half an hour
later the camp had settled down for the night.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span><a name='chXI' id='chXI'></a>CHAPTER XI—A CONTEST OF ENDURANCE</h2>
<p>
“Forty-nine blue bottleth were hanging
on the wall,” muttered Tommy
in her sleep, as Miss Elting and Harriet
stepped into their tent at eight o’clock the
next morning, after having finished their inspection
of the camp. The rest of the Meadow-Brook
Girls were still sleeping soundly.
</p>
<p>
“Poor Tommy,” smiled the guardian.
</p>
<p>
“What is Tommy muttering about forty-nine
blue bottles?” questioned Harriet.
</p>
<p>
The guardian laughed merrily.
</p>
<p>
“I had the girls say that doggerel about the
forty-nine blue bottles while we were stuck fast
in the mud. You see, I wished to keep their
minds from their troubles. We repeated the
song until we were so hoarse we could scarcely
speak.”
</p>
<p>
“I noticed that when I returned, but thought
you had all caught cold. So it was forty-nine
blue bottles that made you so hoarse,” laughed
Harriet. “I think you deserve the real credit
of the rescue. Had you not done what you did
to keep up the spirits of the girls there might
have been a different ending,” declared Harriet Burrell
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span>
with emphasis. She kissed the
guardian impulsively, than stepping softly, to
avoid waking her sleeping companions, she
made her way outside the tent. Shading her
eyes and gazing about she finally discovered a
brown-clad figure sitting on a fence. He evidently
was observing the camp, for, when he
caught sight of Harriet, he waved his hand.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll wager that’s Captain Baker,” smiled
Harriet, waving back to him. “He is a peculiar
young man. We are under great obligations
to them all, but those boys think girls are
of no account. We are going to clash with
them. I know we are.”
</p>
<p>
Harriet poked the fire and built it up until a
cloud of smoke was ascending skyward. It
was not a skilfully made fire, but Harriet had
a purpose in making a great smudge that morning.
She wished to show the tramps that the
girls had just gotten up and were not yet ready
to receive company. She had construed Captain
Baker’s action in watching the camp as
being for the purpose of learning when the
Meadow-Brook outfit was ready to see them.
As the girl cast frequent glances across the
fields she saw the other members of the Tramp
Club scattered about not far from their own
camp, though all of the boys kept a respectful
distance from the camp occupied by the girls.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>
</p>
<p>
Breakfast was out of the way and the camp
of the Meadow-Brook Girls put to rights by
ten o’clock. The travelers felt somewhat lame
and stiff after their experience in the swamp.
Tommy walked with a distinct limp, which Harriet
accused her of putting on for effect.
</p>
<p>
“I’m not pretending,” protested Tommy indignantly.
“I gueth you would walk like I do
if you had been fatht in the mud motht all
night.”
</p>
<p>
Harriet laughed good-naturedly.
</p>
<p>
A halloo out back of the camp cut short any
further argument. It was Captain Baker with
his fellow “tramps.”
</p>
<p>
“Is it too early in the morning to make our
party call?” shouted George.
</p>
<p>
“No. Come right along,” called Harriet
cordially. “We got up rather late this morning.
Didn’t I see you sitting on the fence off
yonder?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I was watching for a woodchuck to
come out. Fellows, you’ve all met Miss Burrell,
I think. And Miss Thompson.”
</p>
<p>
“Yeth I met them in the thwamp,” lisped
Tommy.
</p>
<p>
Miss Elting came out, her face wearing a radiant
smile of welcome for the tramps. Their
hats were off instantly. She insisted on shaking
hands with each of the boys in turn.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>
</p>
<p>
“I suppose you have had your breakfast?”
smiled the guardian.
</p>
<p>
“Breakfast!” exclaimed Davy Dockrill.
“Yes. We men eat our breakfast at six o’clock.
We aren’t like girls, who take their breakfast
in place of luncheon.”
</p>
<p>
“And eat cookies between meals,” laughed
Harriet. “How many miles do you walk a
day?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, a lot,” answered George airily.
</p>
<p>
“How many?” persisted Harriet.
</p>
<p>
“Well, maybe ten, fifteen, twenty miles,
maybe more.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll wager that you take a ride now and
then,” interjected Tommy.
</p>
<p>
“We don’t. We walk, I tell you.”
</p>
<p>
“We aren’t like girls, who have to stop and
rest every half mile or so,” declared Will
Burgess.
</p>
<p>
“And get stuck in the mud,” laughed Fred
Avery.
</p>
<p>
“That’ll be about all, boys,” reproved Captain
Baker, frowning. “I told you these boys
were full of mischief. But you mustn’t mind
them,” he added apologetically.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, we don’t mind them at all,” smiled Harriet.
</p>
<p>
“When are you going to start out again?”
</p>
<p>
“Not until some time to-morrow morning,”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span>
answered Miss Elting. “We are all a little
lame and tired to-day.”
</p>
<p>
The captain nodded gravely.
</p>
<p>
“Yes; girls can’t stand as much as boys when
it comes to hard work like a week or so of walking,”
he said with an air of conviction.
</p>
<p>
“Yeth they can,” resented Tommy. “Girlth
can walk jutht ath far in a day ath boyth can.”
</p>
<p>
“You’ve got to show us before we can believe
that,” declared Davy.
</p>
<p>
“Very well; we will show you,” answered
Harriet quietly. “Name your conditions.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you mean it?” questioned George.
</p>
<p>
“Of course I mean it.”
</p>
<p>
“You’re plucky, all right,” he said regarding
her admiringly. “But I don’t like to have
a contest with girls.”
</p>
<p>
“Why not? Are you afraid of them?” demanded
Margery.
</p>
<p>
The boy flushed.
</p>
<p>
“No, ma’am. It isn’t manly, that’s all.”
</p>
<p>
“You mean it wouldn’t be manly to be beaten
by girls, eh?” suggested Harriet.
</p>
<p>
“Well, yes, I suppose that’s what I mean.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, very well. If you wish to back out,
why, of course——”
</p>
<p>
“Back out? I guess not!” exclaimed Sam.
“We’ll walk your heads off, if you say the
word.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, mercy, no,” protested Harriet, laughingly.
“I hope you will not do anything so terrible
as that. You haven’t said what the conditions
are to be. We must have some rules
if we are to have a hiking contest. They have
rules even in a walking contest, I understand.”
</p>
<p>
Captain Baker pondered a moment.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know about rules. I think it will
have to be a go-as-you-please contest.”
</p>
<p>
“We are willing to abide by whatever you
say,” replied Harriet.
</p>
<p>
“Where do you go to-morrow? I mean
where do you make your next camp?”
</p>
<p>
Harriet consulted their map.
</p>
<p>
“We are going to try to make Hunt’s Corners,”
she said, scrutinizing the map.
</p>
<p>
“May I see that map?” asked Davy.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t think it would be quite fair,” answered
Harriet brightly. “You see, our route
is marked out on the map. Were I to show it
to you, you would know which way we are going.
That would give you an advantage. I will
show the map to you some other time.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course it would be unfair. We don’t
want to see the map, Davy,” rebuked George.
“How far is it to Hunt’s Corners?”
</p>
<p>
“Ten or twelve miles.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t let that trouble you, boys. I’ll be
on hand with the car and I’ll pick up the stragglers,”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>
interjected Jane, joining the group.
She had been at work cleaning her car. Her
face was smudged and her hands blackened.
“If any of you get tired out I’ll promise to take
care of you.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you,” answered the captain, flushing.
His companions laughed at him.
</p>
<p>
“But, Captain,” protested Harriet, “we
haven’t decided on anything. Is this to be a
race for one day, or for all the way home? You
go right through Meadow-Brook, do you not?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. Just as you say. I don’t think you
can stand it to race all the way home.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps not,” answered Harriet dryly.
</p>
<p>
“No. The poor, delicate things,” mourned
Jane. “Just think how you are going to walk
them to death. You boys should be ashamed
of yourselves.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t care if the girls don’t,” laughed
George. “Yes. We’ll walk you all the way in
to Meadow-Brook. The party that gets in first
must give the other side something. What’ll it
be?” asked George.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll take marthhmallowth for mine,” piped
Tommy.
</p>
<p>
“That’s it. A box of candy for each of you
if you win. What do you say, fellows?” questioned
George, appealing to his companions.
</p>
<p>
They nodded, smiling acquiescence.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span>
</p>
<p>
“Suppose we give each of you a handkerchief
if you win,” smiled Harriet.
</p>
<p>
“It’s a go,” declared Captain George.
</p>
<p>
“Then I propose this. Each party is to go
as it chooses. The one that gets in first wins,”
suggested Harriet.
</p>
<p>
“Are tricks barred?” demanded Sam.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know what you mean by tricks.
Strategy isn’t,” returned Harriet.
</p>
<p>
“Whew! That’s a big word,” exclaimed
Dill.
</p>
<p>
“Neither party is to ride, you know,” spoke
up George, eyeing them suspiciously.
</p>
<p>
“Certainly not,” answered Harriet. “We
shouldn’t do such a dishonest thing.”
</p>
<p>
“I beg your pardon. Of course not. You
girls have a car and, perhaps, you might think
it amusing to work a trick on us.”
</p>
<p>
“Our Meadow-Brook Girls aren’t that kind,
Mr. Baker,” interposed Miss Elting severely.
</p>
<p>
“Ride? You couldn’t drag them into the
car,” declared Jane.
</p>
<p>
“By the way, young men, have you seen anything
of two Italians and a bear?” asked Miss
Elting.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. We met them two days ago,” answered
the captain. “Why?”
</p>
<p>
“We had some difficulty with them; that’s
all.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span>
</p>
<p>
“I wish we had known that.” The captain’s
lips compressed, a frown appearing on his forehead.
“What did they do?”
</p>
<p>
Miss Elting told the boys the whole story.
How the boys did laugh when the guardian described
how Jane had chased the Italians about
the field with her car!
</p>
<p>
“We will keep out of the road when you are
abroad, Miss McCarthy,” said George. “I
don’t believe you are a safe person to be allowed
on the highway.”
</p>
<p>
“You are right, she isn’t,” nodded Miss
Elting. “Well, have you settled your plans
for the contest?”
</p>
<p>
“All the plans we can make. We are to walk
to Meadow-Brook. Neither party should actually
walk more than ten hours a day——”
</p>
<p>
“My goodneth,” interrupted Tommy. “Ten
hourth a day. Thave me!”
</p>
<p>
Captain Baker smiled a superior smile and
nodded to his companions.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no. We shouldn’t want to wear you
out to that extent,” replied Harriet mildly.
</p>
<p>
“In the meantime we wish you to come to
supper with us this evening,” invited Miss Elting.
“We will show you that Meadow-Brook
Girls can cook as well as walk. We shan’t
promise you much of a variety, but there will
be plenty to eat. That will give you new
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span>
strength for the coming contest,” she added,
with a mischievous twinkle in her eyes.
</p>
<p>
The captain accepted the invitation for his
friends. He offered to bring over some provisions
and some milk. Jane replied that she
had arranged for the milk, which she was to go
after in her car. It was decided that the boys
need bring nothing with them, there being
enough in camp for all. The Tramp Club went
away, to return at about half past five in the
afternoon.
</p>
<p>
The young men had become very much interested
in the Meadow-Brook Girls. As Captain
Baker characterized them, “They aren’t
the helpless, fainting kind. Those girls know
how to take care of themselves. Now, what do
you think of their fighting off two Italians and
a bear? Fellows, we’ve got to hike some to
beat them! They’ve got something in the back
of their heads that we don’t know about.”
</p>
<p>
“Pshaw! We can walk them off the earth,”
scoffed Sam.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span><a name='chXII' id='chXII'></a>CHAPTER XII—MEADOW-BROOK GIRLS UP A TREE</h2>
<p>
Supper, that night, was a jolly affair.
Miss Elting decided that, though the boys
were full of pranks, they were lads well
worth knowing. She, naturally, was very particular
as to the associates of her charges, but
she approved of the Tramp Club. The boys,
even as their captain had averred at the first
meeting, were “full of mischief.” Despite their
love of fun however they were straightforward,
manly young men.
</p>
<p>
The party broke up about nine o’clock that
evening.
</p>
<p>
“To-morrow the contest begins,” reminded
the captain.
</p>
<p>
“So it does,” answered Harriet, as though
she had overlooked that fact. “What time do
you start?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I don’t know. What time do you
start?”
</p>
<p>
“After breakfast,” laughed Harriet.
</p>
<p>
“Ha, ha! That’s another joke,” chuckled
Dill.
</p>
<p>
“It isn’t as yet. Perhaps it may be to-morrow
night,” replied Harriet. But just how
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>
much of a joke it was to be, or on whom, Harriet
Burrell at that moment did not know. She
rather suspected it would be on the Tramp
Club, but in this conjecture she was wrong.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Harriet, why did you ever get us into
this?” groaned Margery, after the departure of
the boys. “Here am I half dead, with swollen
feet and aching bones, and now I’ve got to enter
a race of I don’t know how many miles against
a lot of athletic boys.”
</p>
<p>
“As I said before, Margery, you may ride
in the car if you prefer.”
</p>
<p>
“No; I’m going through with this hike if it
kills me.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s the way to talk!” nodded Harriet
briskly. “Faint heart never won strong race.”
</p>
<p>
“Have you any plans for fooling the boys,
Harriet?” asked Jane.
</p>
<p>
Harriet shook her head, but, after a gesture
of apology, drew Jane aside, whispering with
her.
</p>
<p>
“Can you spare us a moment, Miss Elting?”
asked Harriet. Soon the three were in earnest
council.
</p>
<p>
“I agree,” called Tommy ironically. “What
ith it? I’m thtrong for it!”
</p>
<p>
“It’s going to be hard work,” declared the
guardian, “and it’ll be rough traveling during
the last five miles, but we’ll be there by noon.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span>
We made no agreement with the boys to stop at
any particular place?”
</p>
<p>
“No, Miss Elting,” Harriet answered.
</p>
<p>
“Then everybody to bed!” ordered the
guardian tersely.
</p>
<p>
At three the next morning four sleepy girls
were tumbled out of bed by a barely less
drowsy chaperon. But swift, silent work had
to be done. Harriet put wood on the still
glowing coals of the fire, then prepared coffee
and a light meal.
</p>
<p>
“Thtop it!” screamed Tommy, when energetic
Jane “struck” the tent, bringing it down
on a pair of heads, the other of which was Margery’s.
</p>
<p>
Jane McCarthy, heedless of their protests,
hustled relentlessly. The girls and their guardian
ate as best they could, under the circumstances.
By the time the light breakfast had
been eaten all the packing had been done, and
everything was ready for moving, except the
dishes and supplies. These were packed by
Margery, Hazel and Tommy. At four o’clock
all was in readiness for the start.
</p>
<p>
“We are going to travel eastward over the
mountains, girls,” explained Harriet. “We
shall have dense forests to go through and
rugged paths to follow, but we shall save a
number of miles and a great deal of time by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span>
going that way. We ought to reach Meadow-Brook
some hours ahead of the boys if they
take the road, as I heard Mr. Baker say they
would. We shall touch the road occasionally,
especially after we get over the mountains. And
you, Jane, must leave a sign on the fence. We
will do the same. Wherever we touch the highway
we will make a sign, also putting down the
time. Those boys don’t know anything about
our secret signs, and they mustn’t.”
</p>
<p>
“Are we all ready?” asked the guardian.
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“You had better start your car quietly,
Jane,” suggested Miss Elting.
</p>
<p>
Jane nodded. She understood. The camp
of the Tramp Club was not so far away but
that the boys could hear the motor plainly if
they were awake, which the girls very much
doubted, as the Tramps had confessed that they
sat up late nights, telling stories, playing Indian
war games and scouting in the woods.
</p>
<p>
“Shoulder packs!” commanded Harriet.
</p>
<p>
A few moments later the four girls with their
guardian, after having put out the fire, started
from the field. They were headed for the highway.
Jane stood beside her car, waving to
them until they were out of sight, then she
calmly climbed into the vehicle and went to
sleep. Crazy Jane had a plan of her own.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span>
</p>
<p>
About five o’clock the camp of the Tramp
Club began to show signs of life. The captain
roused his companions. It had been his intention
to get out earlier, but he had overslept, as
had all of his men. Still, he did not consider
that there was any necessity for great haste.
Of course he had not the slightest idea that the
Meadow-Brook Girls had broken camp at any
such early hour.
</p>
<p>
The boys, while losing no time, made no effort
at great haste. It was nearly six o’clock
when they finished their breakfast and half an
hour later, before they strapped on their packs
and started down the road.
</p>
<p>
Dill Dodd chuckled triumphantly as he
pointed to Jane McCarthy’s automobile standing
right where it had been since the previous
afternoon.
</p>
<p>
“All sleepy heads over there,” nodded Sam.
“We could beat that outfit and sleep all the
time.”
</p>
<p>
“Wait a minute,” answered George. “I
don’t see the tent, do you, fellows?”
</p>
<p>
No one spoke for a moment. Then the leader
announced that he was going down to the girls’
camp. He returned at a trot after having
visited the deserted camp and peered into the
automobile.
</p>
<p>
“Well, what is it?” questioned several boys.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span>
</p>
<p>
“Fellows, we’re stung. They’ve gone!” declared
George.
</p>
<p>
“But—but the automobile is there?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, and that Miss McCarthy is curled up
like a kitten on the back seat sleeping as sweetly
as you please. There’s not another girl in
camp.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, what do you know about that?”
drawled Davy.
</p>
<p>
“How long have they been gone, do you
think?” asked Will.
</p>
<p>
“From the feel of the ashes I should say
several hours.” George did not know that
they had smothered the fire with a damp
blanket. “That was a fine trick to play on us
the first day,” growled George. “That’s the
girl of it.”
</p>
<p>
“Hold on, Cap. You know Miss Burrell,
who seems to be the spokesman for the outfit,
said strategy wasn’t barred. This isn’t a trick,
it’s strategy. There’s a difference between
tricking and strategy you know.”
</p>
<p>
“Boys, we’ve <em>got to</em> catch up with them,” declared
the captain. “Are we going to let a lot
of girls get the best of us?”
</p>
<p>
“No!” shouted the boys in chorus.
</p>
<p>
“Then hike! Don’t lose your wind at the
start. Strike a steady clip, but after half an
hour hit it up, and keep hitting it up till we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span>
catch up with them and take the lead once more.
This is a fine mess, but we’ll soon be out of it
with flying colors.”
</p>
<p>
The Tramp Club walked for two hours without
finding any trace of the Meadow-Brook
Girls. The boys were becoming worried. By
this time they surely ought to have found the
tracks of the girls in the road.
</p>
<p>
“You don’t think they have taken a short cut,
do you?” asked Charlie.
</p>
<p>
Baker shook his head.
</p>
<p>
“They couldn’t get over those mountains.
No; they have been following the side of the
road, so we wouldn’t be able to pick up the trail.
They’re sharp ones. They know something
about trailing. That’s plain to be seen. Hark!
what’s that?”
</p>
<p>
The honk, honk of an automobile horn was
heard in the far distance to the rear of them.
They listened a moment, then pressed on. It
was not an unusual happening to be passed by
a motor car. They soon realized, however, that
this one was coming at a much higher rate of
speed than the statute said was lawful.
</p>
<p>
A cloud of dust arose a full half mile to the
rear of them. As it bore down on the boys the
dust rose higher and higher.
</p>
<p>
“Hoo-e-e-e! Hoo-e-e-e!” yelled a shrill
voice from the heart of the dust cloud.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span>
</p>
<p>
“It’s that Miss McCarthy. They call her
Crazy Jane,” shouted Dill. “Let’s hold her
up.”
</p>
<p>
Bent on mischief, the boys formed a chain
across the road with clasped hands. On came
the car careening from side to side, its horn
honking hoarsely like the warning of a sentinel
crow, its driver uttering her shrill “hoo-e-e-e,”
her hair standing out almost straight behind her
in the breeze.
</p>
<p>
The boys stood firm; the car did not slacken
its speed.
</p>
<p>
“Jump for your lives!” yelled the captain
of the tramps. “She’s going to run us down!”
</p>
<p>
A great black object flitted past them just
as their ranks opened. There was not even
time to get out of the road. The most they
could do was to make an opening large enough—and
barely large enough at that—to permit
the passage of the car, which went roaring past
them. A long-drawn “hoo-e-e-e,” floated back
to them, a choking cloud of dust and sand showered
over them, sending the boys into severe
coughing fits as they staggered off to the side
of the highway and sat down on the dusty grass.
</p>
<p>
“Well, what do you think of that?” gasped
Sam Crocker.
</p>
<p>
“I think it’s exceedingly lucky for us that
we got out of the road when we did,” answered Captain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>
George, shaking an angry fist
in the direction of the disappearing cloud of
dust. “Why, she would have run right over
us.”
</p>
<p>
“She would,” agreed the boys in chorus.
</p>
<p>
“But also she wouldn’t. She knew we would
get out of the way,” added Sam Crocker.
</p>
<p>
“Come on, fellows. This won’t do,” cried
George. “We’ve got to make tracks now.”
They scrambled to their feet and set out at a
fast pace. In the meantime Jane McCarthy,
chuckling over the scare she had given the
Tramp Club, was racing along the highway in
her mad drive to the eastward.
</p>
<p>
A few miles farther on she stopped the car
and after taking a survey of the land, got out
and made some chalk marks on a fence. Then
she drove on more leisurely.
</p>
<p>
While all this was happening the Meadow-Brook
Girls were traveling on, also at a fast
pace. They had gotten over the rugged range
of hills after having sustained some scratches
on their hands and several rents in their frocks.
They then came out into a corn field. A highway
lay below them which they would have to
cross. On the opposite side of the highway
lay an apple orchard, the trees standing close
together, their tops in most instances interlacing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span>
</p>
<p>
“I wonder if the boys have passed here?”
questioned Hazel, shading her eyes and gazing
up and down the road.
</p>
<p>
“No. They must still be a long way back,”
answered Harriet.
</p>
<p>
The Meadow-Brook Girls started down the
hill, climbing the fence into the road. There
before them, plainly discernible, were the tracks
of an automobile.
</p>
<p>
“Jane went past here not long ago,” decided
Margery. “These are her car tracks, I am
sure.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, and there’s a chalk mark on the fence,”
said Miss Elting, pointing down the road a few
rods. They hurried over to examine the sign.
</p>
<p>
“A broken arrow,” exclaimed Harriet.
“That means danger or ‘look out.’ Now, I
wonder what we are to look out for? I don’t
see anything alarming.”
</p>
<p>
“I think Jane means to inform us that the
boys are not far from here and to look out for
them,” suggested the guardian.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, that must be it. Half-past twelve, the
signal says, she passed here. That is nearly
an hour ago. Come, girls, let’s get over that
fence in a hurry and be off. Once through the
orchard, and they can’t see us,” urged Harriet
Burrell.
</p>
<p>
“Wait; let’s be certain that we are right,”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span>
warned the guardian. She took a careful survey
about them. Nothing of an alarming nature
was to be seen. It was just an ordinary
country scene, with the sun shining down overhead,
the air warm and oppressive about them.
</p>
<p>
“Everything appears to be all right,” she
decided finally. “Yes, go ahead, girls.” Miss
Elting was the first to climb the roadside fence
and drop down on the other side. She was
quickly followed by the four girls of her party.
“Keep on the alert, girls. If any of you
catches sight of the boys drop down behind
trees and don’t speak.” The guardian had entered
into the spirit of the contest with an enthusiasm
equal to that of the girls themselves.
“I can’t believe that they have gotten ahead
of us. It isn’t probable that that was what
Jane meant when she marked the danger signal
on the fence here.”
</p>
<p>
“Wait,” called Harriet. Springing back over
the fence she wrote the letters “O. K.” underneath
the broken arrow and the triangle. This
was for the purpose of informing Jane that
her message had been read and understood in
case she were to return that way later on, as
she was more than likely to do.
</p>
<p>
This done they started briskly in among the
trees of the orchard. They had not gone far
before Tommy, who was in the lead, uttered a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span>
shrill little scream of alarm. The girls had
started to run toward her when they halted
abruptly. Just ahead of them stood a great
hulking bull with head lowered to the ground,
his small eyes fixed menacingly on the girls.
The bull uttered a deep, rumbling bellow.
</p>
<p>
“Thave me! Oh, thave me!” wailed Tommy.
</p>
<p>
“Run for your lives, girls,” shouted the
guardian.
</p>
<p>
They turned and were about to flee for the
road when they came to another abrupt stop.
To the right and the left of them were two
other bulls, each with lowered head, pawing the
dirt with first one front foot then the other.
</p>
<p>
All at once the girls understood the meaning
of Jane’s danger sign. She had seen the
bulls in passing, and knowing that her companions
would pass that way, had halted to
leave a warning for them.
</p>
<p>
“Quick! Into the trees!” shouted Miss
Elting. She grabbed the trembling Tommy and
helped her up into a tree, Harriet in the meantime
performing the same service for Margery
and Hazel. Then the guardian and Harriet began
scrambling up, but ere they had gotten off
the ground the bulls charged them.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span><a name='chXIII' id='chXIII'></a>CHAPTER XIII—A SERIOUS PREDICAMENT</h2>
<p>
“Climb! Miss Elting, climb!” begged
Harriet.
</p>
<p>
Margery and Tommy uttered shrill
cries of terror.
</p>
<p>
The guardian reached for the crotch of the
tree, just above her head, and drew herself up.
Harriet leaped into the air, catching hold of
an overhanging limb. She intended to pull
herself free from the ground and out of the
reach of the angry bulls.
</p>
<p>
The limb snapped. Apple tree boughs always
are treacherous. Harriet landed on the ground
in a heap. A gasp of horror escaped from the
lips of the girls in the trees near at hand.
</p>
<p>
There followed a bellow and a rush from
the third bull, which was some few yards distant
from its fellows. The girls closed their
eyes as the lowered head and wicked-looking
horns seemed to come into contact with Harriet
Burrell’s body. Miss Elting, strong-nerved
as she was, could not repress a scream. Margery,
utterly terror-stricken, lost her balance,
and had it not been for Hazel, who threw an
arm about her, Margery would have fallen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span>
from the tree and been at the mercy of the savage
bulls.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, having heard no scream
from Harriet, the girls opened their eyes fearfully.
They saw Harriet leaping for a higher
limb of the tree. The head of the bull had
crashed against the base of the tree where Harriet
had been but a second before.
</p>
<p>
With remarkable presence of mind the girl,
when she struck the ground, had rolled herself
to one side, thus placing the tree between
herself and her assailant. This gave her a few
seconds respite. But in these few seconds Harriet
gathered her faculties together. Springing
to her feet she had flung herself straight
up into the air, with arms thrown above her
head to grasp the limb that her quick eyes had
noted.
</p>
<p>
Most girls would have fainted, but Harriet
Burrell did not. She was not of the fainting
kind, as Captain Baker had so truly said a few
hours before. A few awful seconds of suspense
followed.
</p>
<p>
With feet curled under her, the girl’s hands
reached and clasped the limb. Then she drew
herself up to it; a feat requiring both muscle
and practice. Once there she lay along the
creaking limb of the apple tree just out of
reach of the tossing horns, gazing down into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>
the bloodshot eyes of the ferocious beast. The
limb bent perilously. It threatened, at any
second, to give way beneath her weight.
</p>
<p>
“Climb higher!” cried Miss Elting, “oh,
climb higher!”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t dare move. The limb may break
if I do,” answered Harriet in a wholly calm
voice.
</p>
<p>
“Thave me, thave me!” wailed Tommy
Thompson weakly.
</p>
<p>
“What shall we do? Please be careful, Harriet,”
begged the guardian in an agonized
voice.
</p>
<p>
“I intend to be careful. I haven’t any burning
desire to fall on those sharp horns. I
never saw such a fiendish expression in the
eyes of an animal.”
</p>
<p>
The limb creaked warningly. Harriet instantly
ceased speaking. Somehow, she thought,
the muscular effort of speaking must be putting
a little added weight on the limb.
</p>
<p>
The bull walked away a few paces. He
stopped and began bellowing and pawing.
</p>
<p>
“See if you can’t call him away. I simply
don’t dare to move as long as he is so near,”
said Harriet.
</p>
<p>
“How shall I call him?” questioned the
guardian.
</p>
<p>
“Flaunt something at him.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span>
</p>
<p>
“I haven’t anything to flaunt.”
</p>
<p>
“Wait till I take off my thkirt,” piped the
little lisping girl.
</p>
<p>
“Be careful that you don’t fall,” warned
Harriet.
</p>
<p>
Tommy quickly stripped off her skirt, then
leaning over, swung it back and forth. Instantly
there was a bellow and a charge from
the enraged bull. The skirt was whisked from
her hands on the sharp horns of the furious
animal that had charged it.
</p>
<p>
“Thave me!” cried Tommy. “Oh, thave my
thkirt!”
</p>
<p>
There was reason for alarm in Tommy’s case
at that moment. The bull was tossing its head
to release the skirt that had become impaled
upon the sharp horns. Presently the skirt fell
to the ground. The animal began stamping
upon and prodding it. Tommy got into action
at about the same time. Shrieking and protesting,
she began pelting the animal with
apples that she picked from the tree for the
purpose. Some of the missiles reached their
mark. Most of them did not.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my thkirt, my thkirt!” wailed the little
girl.
</p>
<p>
“Never mind, you have saved Harriet,”
comforted Miss Elting.
</p>
<p>
Harriet, the instant the bull left her, started
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span>
to wriggle backwards. The limb gave way
with a crash, and Harriet plunged to the
ground, but by skilfully twisting her body she
avoided striking on her head. She was up like
a flash and once more sprang for the tree. This
time she did not trust to a treacherous limb,
but scrambled hastily up the trunk and perched
herself high and safe in the crotch of the tree
a few seconds later.
</p>
<p>
“Gracious! That was a narrow escape,”
gasped the guardian. “How do you feel?”
</p>
<p>
“I am all right.” Harriet smiled faintly.
Her cheeks were pale and her eyes large and
bright. There were no other indications that
she was disturbed at her succession of narrow
escapes from the bull. “Poor Tommy, you
lost your skirt, didn’t you?”
</p>
<p>
“Ye—eth. Oh, what thhall I do?”
</p>
<p>
“I guess you will have to finish the day’s
hike in your petticoat,” answered Miss Elting.
“However, from present indications it will be
dark by the time we get away from here. Besides
your petticoat is black and will easily
pass for an outside skirt.”
</p>
<p>
“I can’t, I can’t,” wailed the girl. “I won’t
go on thith way.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t worry, Tommy. You may have my
skirt. I don’t mind going without it at all. I
have a black underskirt, so the absence of my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span>
outside skirt will hardly be noticed,” answered
Harriet.
</p>
<p>
“I won’t. The naughty old bull. I want my
own thkirt.”
</p>
<p>
“You won’t need it,” said Margery, speaking
for the first time since she had been overcome
with terror.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you think they will go away?” questioned
Hazel anxiously.
</p>
<p>
“Not so long as we are up here,” replied
Harriet. “I know their kind pretty well. I
was chased by one at grandfather’s farm two
years ago. There is only one way to save yourself
from them when they are angry—that is
to keep out of their way. I think——”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, look! Look, girls!” cried Hazel in a
tone of suppressed eagerness.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, thave me! There they come,” moaned
Tommy.
</p>
<p>
“It’s the Tramp Club as I live,” exclaimed
Miss Elting. “Girls, we must call to them. It
is a humiliating position for us, but we must
get out of here. They can at least go for the
farmer and ask him to drive the animals off.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Miss Elting, please don’t call to them,”
begged Harriet.
</p>
<p>
The boys were swinging down the road at a
rapid but steady pace. They were walking in
step, each with a heavy pack on his back, hat
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span>
brims tilted back, a manly looking lot of young
men. As they reached a point opposite to the
lower end of the orchard they began to sing,
their voices raised in chorus:
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Forty-nine&nbsp;&nbsp;blue&nbsp;&nbsp;bottles&nbsp;&nbsp;are&nbsp;&nbsp;hanging&nbsp;&nbsp;on&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;wall,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forty-nine&nbsp;&nbsp;blue&nbsp;&nbsp;bottles&nbsp;&nbsp;are&nbsp;&nbsp;hanging&nbsp;&nbsp;on&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;wall.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take&nbsp;&nbsp;one&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;bottles&nbsp;&nbsp;down&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;there’ll&nbsp;&nbsp;be&nbsp;&nbsp;forty-eight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blue&nbsp;&nbsp;bottles&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;hanging&nbsp;&nbsp;on&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;wall,&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;hanging&nbsp;&nbsp;on<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;wall.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take&nbsp;&nbsp;one&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;bottles&nbsp;&nbsp;down&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;there’ll&nbsp;&nbsp;be&nbsp;&nbsp;forty-eight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blue&nbsp;&nbsp;bottles&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;hanging&nbsp;&nbsp;on&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;wall,&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;hanging&nbsp;&nbsp;on<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;wall.”<br />
</p>
<p>
“Oh, help!” moaned Margery Brown.
</p>
<p>
“Thave me!” wailed Tommy.
</p>
<p>
Harriet and Miss Elting burst out laughing,
but not loudly enough for their laughter to
reach the Tramp Club, the members of which
organization were trudging along past the
orchard, wholly unconscious of the nearness of
their friends.
</p>
<h2><a name='chXIV' id='chXIV'></a>CHAPTER XIV—HARRIET IS RESOURCEFUL</h2>
<p>
The boys were still removing blue bottles
from the wall as they swung on out of
sight of the girls in the apple trees.
Harriet Burrell was shaking with laughter.
</p>
<p>
“That ith right. Laugh!” jeered Tommy.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span>
“I gueth it ith funny, but I don’t thee it.
Maybe I’ll laugh, to-morrow.”
</p>
<p>
“It is really the most laughable situation I
ever heard of,” admitted the guardian.
</p>
<p>
“One side of it, yes,” agreed Harriet. “The
other side isn’t so funny. We must think of
getting out of here. All our plans have come
to nothing. The boys have passed us. I am
afraid we shan’t be able to catch up with them
again unless we can get a start before long.”
</p>
<p>
The bulls, attracted by the singing, had
turned, now facing the road. They regarded
the boys menacingly, but the Tramp Club did
not see them. Now the animals once more
turned toward the trees that held the girls.
The beasts resumed their bellowing and pawing
and moved up under the trees, tossing their
heads, issuing challenge after challenge to the
girls to come down. But the challenges were
not accepted. Harriet regarded the beasts
frowningly. The other girls gazed at them in
terror.
</p>
<p>
“Now, Harriet Burrell, as you wouldn’t
allow me to call the boys, what do you propose
to do? Remain up in a tree all night?” demanded
the guardian.
</p>
<p>
“By no means.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t dare thleep up here,” complained
Tommy. “What if I thhould fall out?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span>
</p>
<p>
“You wouldn’t have far to fall,” answered
Margery.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, wouldn’t it be awful,” gasped Hazel,
“if we were to fall out of these trees?”
</p>
<p>
“The animals will go to sleep themselves
after dark, I am sure. We shall be able to get
away then,” replied Harriet wisely.
</p>
<p>
“I believe you are right. I hadn’t thought
of that,” nodded Miss Elting. “But must we
remain in this position all the rest of the day?”
</p>
<p>
“No, indeed,” replied Harriet. “I had
hoped that the owner of these animals might
come along, but there seems to be no one about.
You see, in the autumn, the farmers are seldom
abroad in the fields unless they chance to be
plowing, so I think we had better move.”
</p>
<p>
“What have you in mind, Harriet? I know
you have formed some plan to get us out of
this predicament.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I have. The plan may not work, but
it is worth trying. I wish you would call the
beasts to your tree. I can depend upon you.
You will not lose your head. You will have to
use your own skirt this time, but for goodness’
sake, don’t lose it. Some one must be presentable
when we get to camp.”
</p>
<p>
“See here, Harriet, I positively forbid your
taking any further chances. You have had
enough narrow escapes to-day as it is.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>
</p>
<p>
“There will be no particular danger for me,
Miss Elting. You will be in more danger than
I shall be when the plan really begins to work.
Will you call the bulls over to your tree?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. But I warn you I shan’t be a party
to any more foolishness.”
</p>
<p>
Harriet made no reply. She scanned the
orchard about her, finally fixing her eyes upon
a tree with low-hanging limbs, situated several
rods farther down the orchard and away from
the road. The girl nodded, as though in answer
to some question she had asked of herself.
</p>
<p>
“Now I am ready. I have removed my
skirt,” called the guardian. “What next?”
</p>
<p>
“Wait a moment.” Harriet clambered down
the tree a little way, placing herself in a position
where she could jump without loss of time.
“Now wave your skirt, please.”
</p>
<p>
Miss Elting leaned down from her position
in the tree and began swinging her skirt slowly
back and forth. The result was immediate and
startling. With bellows of rage, three savage
bulls with lowered heads charged the blue
skirt. It seems that these animals were not
particular as to color. Blue was every bit as
aggravating as red to them.
</p>
<p>
Harriet, the instant the beasts began charging,
had dropped fearlessly to the ground. The
bulls had not observed her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span>
</p>
<p>
“Harriet!” screamed Margery.
</p>
<p>
Harriet gave no heed to the cry of alarm.
Instead she ran with all speed farther down
the orchard, casting apprehensive glances over
her shoulder now and then. A cry of warning
from Miss Elting told her that the bulls had
turned and were charging her. Harriet gave
one quick glance over her shoulder, then leaped
for a tree, up which she clambered with agility.
She was none too soon, for, by the time she had
cleared the trunk, the bulls met at the tree with
horns clashing. For a moment they turned
their attention to each other and then backed
away and looked up at their intended victim.
</p>
<p>
“Miss Elting!” called the girl.
</p>
<p>
“Yes?”
</p>
<p>
“I am going to decoy the bulls as far away
from you as possible. When you hear me
scream you are all to climb down from the trees
and run for the road fence. I’ll try to hold
the ugly beasts here while you are making the
dash. But run for your life. Don’t you dare
to fall down.”
</p>
<p>
“All of us?” questioned the guardian apprehensively.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, please.”
</p>
<p>
“But, Harriet—suppose that we do get
safely away—how are you going to leave the
orchard?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>
</p>
<p>
“I have thought of a way to do it,” Harriet
assured the guardian. “The danger, now,
is in so many of us being here. When I scream
the first time you are to run. When you get
safely over the fence you are to give me the
signal ‘hoo-e-e-e-e.’ I will know, by that, that
you are safe. When I give you a second call,
after you are in the highway, try to attract the
attention of the bulls. That will be my chance
to make a dash for the nearest fence.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t like your plan,” objected the guardian.
“You are taking too great a risk.”
</p>
<p>
“It is the only way we can get away from
here before night,” argued Harriet. “Even
then, we should find it difficult to escape, for
I think the beasts would camp right under
these trees. They are determined to get us.
I’m going to fool them. Now, call them!”
</p>
<p>
The guardian did so. The animals did not
show any immediate inclination to move. So
Miss Elting cautiously got down to the ground.
That was all that was necessary. The beasts
charged her. The guardian lost no time in
scrambling into the tree. In the meantime Harriet
had again dropped to the ground and was
running at the top of her speed. She was still
within easy reach of the voices of her companions,
though out of their sight.
</p>
<p>
“Where are they?” she called.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span>
</p>
<p>
“Right here,” answered the guardian.
</p>
<p>
“All right. Don’t try to keep them there.
I am not afraid.”
</p>
<p>
“We have no desire to, I assure you, Harriet.
But do be careful.”
</p>
<p>
Harriet was still on the ground. She moved
a little farther down through the orchard, getting
out where the trees were less thick, so
as to be still within sight of the beasts she was
hoping to lure away from the trees that held
her companions. The bulls did not appear to
see her, so Harriet stripped off her own skirt
and began waving it at them. It was several
moments later when the bulls discovered her
and then they started for her without loss of
time.
</p>
<p>
“Run!” screamed Harriet. “Run! Don’t
make a sound to attract their attention.” She
adopted her own advice and started down
through an aisle of apple trees, her feet scarcely
seeming to touch the ground. The girl was
flaunting her skirt over her head. She heard
bellows of rage off toward the trees in which
her companions were perched. The girl halted.
A few seconds later she saw the beasts coming.
Instead of immediately taking to a tree Harriet
began running again, still waving the skirt
high above her head.
</p>
<p>
Harriet heard Tommy give a little scream.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span>
It was quickly suppressed. Undoubtedly Miss
Elting had sharply rebuked the terrified little
girl. Harriet did not pause again. This was
her last chance to get the bulls away from the
trees that held her companions. Their safety
depended upon her doing so. She was determined
to succeed, even at the imminent risk of
losing her own safety. The animals did not
seem to be gaining on her, but all at once they
put on a great burst of speed. Harriet darted
sideways, then straight ahead again. This time
she leaped out into the open, flaunting the skirt,
tantalizing the ugly beasts, resorting to every
artifice she could think of to take their attention
from Miss Elting and the other girls.
</p>
<p>
Harriet succeeded beyond her expectations.
She also succeeded in enraging the beasts far
more than she had hoped to do.
</p>
<p>
Now they were getting too close for safety,
so Harriet darted in among the trees, followed
by the three savage, bellowing bulls. She
grasped the first low-hanging limb that she
came to, and swung herself up into a tree. A
pair of sharp horns caught the end of the skirt,
rending it nearly to the waist. Harriet clung
desperately to the skirt. She did not propose
to lose it if she could help doing so. Jerking
the skirt away she climbed higher and, bracing
herself, gazed down triumphantly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>
</p>
<p>
“That’s the time I fooled you, didn’t I?” she
taunted. Leaning forward the girl waved the
skirt. She reached down far enough to flaunt
the skirt full in the face of the nearest animal.
He bellowed his rage and pawed the dirt. She
continued to aggravate him. If she could only
keep them all there until her companions
reached the highway!
</p>
<p>
“Hoo-e-e-e-e!” sounded the distant, long-drawn
call of the Meadow-Brook Girls.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, they’re safe!” cried Harriet joyfully.
For a moment she closed her eyes and clung
panting to the trunk of the tree. After resting
a few moments she cautiously drew on her
skirt and fastened it, three pairs of red, evil
eyes observing her threateningly. Then she
climbed to the topmost branches of the apple
tree, hoping to get high enough to obtain a
glimpse of her companions.
</p>
<p>
“I might have known that a tree with such
low boughs would not be high enough for
that,” she muttered. “But I’ll call.”
</p>
<p>
Listening she heard the “Hoo-e-e-e!” of Miss
Elting again.
</p>
<p>
“Hoo-e-e-e-e-e-e! Hoo-e-e-e-e!” answered
Harriet Burrell.
</p>
<p>
In response the others began shouting. The
bulls did not appear to be interested. One of
them lay down.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span>
</p>
<p>
“My goodness! I do hope they aren’t going
to stay here the rest of the day,” cried Harriet.
“I don’t know what I shall do in that
event.”
</p>
<p>
She now tried Tommy’s plan and began pelting
the animal that had lain down with apples.
It took very little of this sort of treatment to
bring the beast to his feet. He leaped up with
a bellow and began pawing up the dirt, sending
showers of it over his companions.
</p>
<p>
Harriet chuckled.
</p>
<p>
“Now, if only Miss Elting will attract their
attention. I think I had better try to hide
myself and keep quiet.” This she did. She
could hear the shouts and yells of her companions.
They were setting up a great racket off
there in the road, doing their utmost to draw
the attention of the animals away from Harriet.
</p>
<p>
After fully five minutes of this one of the
bulls walked off with his head in the air. He
stood a moment with head still erect, gazing
off toward the highway. Suddenly he started
on a run. The other two bulls followed him
with their gaze for a few moments, then they,
too, started away at a moderate trot.
</p>
<p>
“The plan has worked! It has worked!”
cried Harriet in triumph, under her breath.
“Oh, I do hope they get far enough away. I
must crawl down so as to be ready for my big
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span>
spring. This is almost equal to a Spanish bull
fight, except that I haven’t any barbs to stick
into them.”
</p>
<p>
The girl crept cautiously to the ground. She
stood at the foot of the tree, shielding her body
by its trunk, peering around the tree at the
running bulls. They were headed straight
toward the road fence, traveling more rapidly
now.
</p>
<p>
In order to reach the fence at the side of the
field, Harriet would be obliged to go out into
the open, where, if the animals turned, she
would be sure to be discovered.
</p>
<p>
A cry from her companions told her that the
time for action on her part had arrived. Without
an instant’s hesitation Harriet Burrell
started for a fence which stood to the eastward
of her place of refuge. A few moments later
she had cleared the orchard and reached the
open field. She saw the three bulls pawing the
ground by the roadside fence in the distance.
Her companions were standing in the middle
of the road waving their skirts at the animals,
not daring to get close to the fence.
</p>
<p>
“Run! Run, Harriet!” screamed Miss Elting.
</p>
<p>
As though they had understood the meaning
of the guardian’s warning, the bulls wheeled
sharply. They saw the fleeing figure of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span>
Meadow-Brook Girl and, leaving Miss Elting
and her party, charged straight across the field
towards Harriet, while the latter was still some
distance from the fence towards which she was
running.
</p>
<p>
“Run! Oh, run!” came the voice of Miss
Elting in a terrified wail. “Run!”
</p>
<p>
Suddenly, Harriet, who had turned to glance
over her shoulder to measure the distance between
herself and her pursuers, stumbled and
plunged headfirst into a little depression in the
ground.
</p>
<p>
A scream rose from her horrified companions.
</p>
<h2><a name='chXV' id='chXV'></a>CHAPTER XV—A RACE FOR LIFE</h2>
<p>
“She’ll be killed!” wailed Hazel, covering
her eyes to shut out the sight.
</p>
<p>
“Thave her!” screamed Tommy.
The little girl sprang forward, scrambled over
the fence and, had she, too, not fallen would
have dashed down the field to Harriet Burrell’s
assistance, utterly regardless of her own
peril. The guardian climbed over the fence
and had placed a firm grip on the little girl
before the latter could get to her feet. Miss
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>
Elting fairly dragged Tommy back to the fence
and assisted her over.
</p>
<p>
“She’s up again!” cried Hazel. “Oh, hurry,
hurry!” Her voice rose to a piercing wail.
</p>
<p>
Harriet had gotten to her feet. She cast one
frightened look over her shoulder, then continued
to run towards the fence. They saw
that she limped a little. Nor was the girl running
as fast as before her fall. The three bulls
had gained considerably during the few seconds
that Harriet had been down. They were
now charging with lowered heads, bunched
closely together, this time as though determined
that their victim should not escape them.
</p>
<p>
Just ahead of her, Harriet had seen a ditch,
deep and broad, made for the purpose of draining
the land. Instantly a plan formed in her
active mind. She could not hope to win the
race for life by running straight ahead now
that the beasts had gained so much on her.
</p>
<p>
“She’s tiring! They’ll get her!” moaned
Hazel.
</p>
<p>
“Why didn’t you let me go?” screamed
Tommy, beside herself with anxiety.
</p>
<p>
The guardian did not answer. Her eyes,
wide and staring, were following every movement
of the fleeing girl and the pursuing bulls.
</p>
<p>
Harriet stopped short, bending over in a
crouching position.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>
</p>
<p>
“She’s going to try to trick them! Oh, what
courage!” breathed Miss Elting.
</p>
<p>
“Look! Thee her now!” shouted Tommy,
with a note of triumph in her strained voice.
</p>
<p>
The animals were fairly upon Harriet. When
it seemed as though their horns were touching
her, the girl leaped obliquely into the ditch.
They saw her run, splashing along in it for a
few rods, then spring to the bank on the same
side from which she had jumped in.
</p>
<p>
The watchers saw something else too. The
bulls, so intent upon reaching their victim, had
taken no notice of the ditch. Perhaps they had
been charging with closed eyes, as many bulls
do. At any rate the leading beast flung himself
headlong into the ditch. The others braced
themselves with their front feet and went sliding
into the ditch on top of their leader, digging
furrows with their hoofs in the soft dirt.
</p>
<p>
Harriet Burrell’s ruse had been successful.
She spoke no word, but a glint of triumph
flashed into her eyes as she cast a quick glance
at the floundering animals, then ran straight
toward her companions. This time there was
no limping, no lessening of speed. She had
covered less than half the distance before two
of the animals that had slid into the ditch had
recovered themselves and began looking about
for the prey that had eluded them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span>
</p>
<p>
The slender figure of the Meadow-Brook
girl, they soon discovered, was racing across
the field. The two bulls clambered out of the
ditch and charged again. Now that they were
in the open field it was a race that would go
to the fleetest. No tricks would avail Harriet
this time. She knew that her safety depended
on outrunning her pursuers. Had Harriet not
been an athletic girl she would have succumbed
long before. As it was she ran at a wonderful
rate of speed. The shouts of her companions,
though heard but faintly, encouraged her,
for Harriet’s mind was on her work.
</p>
<p>
The ruse practiced by Harriet had given
her the lead in the race. Miss Elting, however,
saw that the bulls were gaining on the plucky
girl.
</p>
<p>
“Girls,” she said sharply, “remain where
you are.” With that she climbed to the top
of the fence and leaped over into the field.
It was her idea that even though Harriet did
succeed in reaching the fence, the girl might
not have sufficient vitality left to enable her to
climb over it.
</p>
<p>
Harriet, as she drew near, discovered the
guardian on her side of the fence and divined
the latter’s purpose. The girl motioned for
Miss Elting to get back. The guardian shook
her head and remained where she was.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span>
</p>
<p>
“Go back! Go back! I’m all right,” cried
Harriet breathlessly.
</p>
<p>
The bulls were gaining rapidly. They were
now but a few rods behind Harriet Burrell.
She put on more speed after one last look over
her shoulder while Tommy and Hazel were
shouting their encouragement.
</p>
<p>
“You will be caught. Quick!” gasped Harriet,
as she drew rapidly near to the guardian.
“Oh, please hurry back to the road!”
</p>
<p>
Miss Elting did not move. Harriet dashed
up beside her and stopped short. Miss Elting
grasped the girl’s arm. Harriet pulled herself
free.
</p>
<p>
“Not an inch till you get over,” declared the
girl.
</p>
<p>
The guardian glanced at her questioningly,
then vaulted the fence. Harriet followed her.
But ere Harriet had touched the ground on
the other side, two sharp-horned heads crashed
into the fence. Harriet sank down at the side
of the road breathless and exhausted.
</p>
<p>
Miss Elting pulled the girl to her feet.
</p>
<p>
“Throw your shoulders well back and inhale
deeply!” she commanded. She then led Harriet
slowly up and down the road for a few
moments. Harriet’s heavy respirations soon
moderated, and ten minutes later her breathing
was almost normal.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>
</p>
<p>
“I think we had better wait here. Jane will
be along looking for us if we do not get to our
camping place by night. Do you feel exhausted?”
asked Miss Elting.
</p>
<p>
“A little weak in the knees, that’s all,” answered
Harriet. “I shall be ready to move in
a few minutes. I don’t want to stay here. We
must try to catch up with the boys.”
</p>
<p>
“No. I shall not allow it. Yon have done
quite enough for one day—quite enough to tire
out the strongest man. Do you really think
you can stand it to walk slowly?”
</p>
<p>
“Of course I can,” answered Harriet
brightly. “See, I still have some sprint left
in me.” Harriet ran up and down the road,
vaulting the fence on the opposite side of it.
</p>
<p>
“You have indeed,” laughed Miss Elting. It
was the first laugh that had been heard in some
time. “You are the most remarkable girl I’ve
ever known, or ever shall know. Now we had
better decide on which way we shall go. I think
the shorter way will be to skirt the orchard and
continue on across the fields. We shan’t try
the orchard again.”
</p>
<p>
All the girls agreed with the guardian. They
had had quite enough of that particular orchard.
Following the road for a short distance they
came to the adjoining field, which they entered
and continued on their journey. The afternoon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span>
was now well advanced. Miss Elting had left a
mark on the fence to inform Jane of their route,
in case she should come back to look for them.
This with the time of their passing would give
Jane an idea when to expect them at the place
stretched for the camp.
</p>
<p>
As they proceeded, Harriet’s strength returned
to her. By the time they had walked
two miles from the scene of their recent exciting
experiences she had fully recovered from
her recent exhaustion. Tommy, now that she
had time to think about herself, was bewailing
the loss of her skirt. She firmly declared she
would not go to camp with only an underskirt
on and announced her intention of sleeping out
in the fields.
</p>
<p>
Six o’clock had arrived by the time they came
out on the crest of a hill overlooking the valley
in which they hoped to find Jane McCarthy and
their camp. They scanned the valley eagerly.
</p>
<p>
“There’s our tent,” cried Hazel, pointing to
a clump of trees to the left of them. No person
was in sight, however. This they thought
strange.
</p>
<p>
“I should not be surprised if everybody had
gone in search of us,” said Miss Elting.
</p>
<p>
“I hope they don’t find uth,” spoke up
Tommy.
</p>
<p>
“It will be a good opportunity for you to get
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span>
into camp without being seen,” suggested Harriet.
“Come, let’s hurry down before some one
does come.”
</p>
<p>
In order that their approach might be the
more screened, they hurried over to a fence
along which bushes and small trees grew. Sheltered
by these they made their way down into
the valley. But when they reached the road
Tommy halted.
</p>
<p>
“Not another thtep,” she declared stubbornly.
No amount of urging would induce
her to go on. It was decided to leave her there
while the rest continued on, Harriet promising
to return to the little girl with another skirt
as soon as possible. So Tommy hid in the
bushes, peering out at the retreating forms of
her companions.
</p>
<p>
A fire was smouldering in the Meadow-Brook
camp. As the party of girls approached, four
boys sprang up. They had been sitting about
the fire. Their hats were off instantly, and
they tried gallantly to force down the grins
that persisted in appearing on their faces.
</p>
<p>
“Why, how do you do?” greeted Captain
Baker of the Tramp Club.
</p>
<p>
“Where is Miss McCarthy?” questioned Miss
Elting, pretending not to have observed the
grins.
</p>
<p>
“She and a couple of the fellows went back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span>
to look for you,” spoke up Dill Dodd. “The
pace was rather swift for you, even if you did
get an early start, wasn’t it?” he chuckled.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, the pace was much swifter than you
imagine,” answered the guardian frigidly.
</p>
<p>
“It is too bad that Miss McCarthy started
out. She may spend a good part of the evening
searching for you, not knowing that you have
reached camp,” said the captain.
</p>
<p>
“She will know,” replied Harriet. “Jane
will be back here soon.”
</p>
<p>
“How will she know?” frowned Davy.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, they have a wireless telegraph system,
you know,” chuckled Sam.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, that is it! How did you guess it?”
smiled Harriet.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t forget Tommy,” reminded Miss
Elting.
</p>
<p>
Harriet flushed. She had indeed, forgotten
all about the little lisping girl who was hiding
in the bushes. Harriet hurried into the tent.
</p>
<p>
“That’s right. You are one girl short,” exclaimed
George, suddenly discovering the absence
of Miss Thompson. “Did she fall by the
wayside? Was the pace too swift for her?”
</p>
<p>
“Young man, you talk too much,” objected
Margery indignantly.
</p>
<p>
“I know it,” laughed George. “I can’t help
it.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>
</p>
<p>
Miss Elting’s face relaxed in a smile.
</p>
<p>
“Where <em>is</em> Miss Thompson?” questioned
Dill.
</p>
<p>
“Miss Thompson will be here soon,” replied
the guardian.
</p>
<p>
Unnoticed by the boys Harriet slipped away,
a bundle under her arm. She returned, a quarter
of an hour later, accompanied by Tommy
clad in her outside skirt and at peace with the
world. They had barely reached the camp before
the sound of a motor horn was heard. A
few moments afterward Crazy Jane came tearing
along the road and swung up to the camp.
</p>
<p>
“Here we are darlin’s,” she cried. “I got
your message.”
</p>
<p>
“Message?” questioned the captain. “Who
gave her a message, Fred?”
</p>
<p>
“Blest if I know,” answered Fred Avery, getting
down from the car, removing his hat and
scratching his head thoughtfully. “Wireless, I
think.”
</p>
<p>
“What did I tell you?” nodded Sam.
</p>
<p>
The captain regarded Fred inquiringly.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, don’t ask me,” said the latter. “Miss
McCarthy got out of her car about five miles
back, walked to the fence then back to the car.
She said her friends had passed there about
four o’clock in the afternoon and were in camp
then.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span>
</p>
<p>
“Well, what do you know about that?” wondered
the captain. “Tell us how you did it?”
</p>
<p>
“A little bird told me,” chuckled Jane.
The girls burst into a merry peal of laughter.
</p>
<h2><a name='chXVI' id='chXVI'></a>CHAPTER XVI—A TREAT THAT WAS NOT A TREAT</h2>
<p>
“Never mind. We won’t be as mean as
you are,” declared Sam, springing up.
“We will return good for evil.”
</p>
<p>
“Did you see the three bulls?” interrupted
Jane. “I knew you would cross that orchard
and I was afraid you’d meet them.”
</p>
<p>
“We did,” answered Miss Elting.
</p>
<p>
“What’s that?” The captain was interested
instantly. “You say you met the bulls?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. I might as well tell you,” explained
Miss Elting. “You think we weren’t able to
keep the pace we set for ourselves. I don’t
want my girls to rest under that imputation, for
I believe that they can completely outdistance
you boys. We did meet the three bulls. Yes,
they treed us. We were all up in apple trees
when you boys passed singing ‘Forty-nine Blue
Bottles.’”
</p>
<p>
Some one laughed. The captain frowned at
the boy who had done so.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>
</p>
<p>
“You let us pass, and never called us to come
to your assistance?” he demanded.
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“Why?”
</p>
<p>
“We preferred to get out of our scrape without
appealing to our rivals, Captain Baker.”
</p>
<p>
“Whew! That was a fix. How’d you manage
it?”
</p>
<p>
“Through the resourcefulness and courage of
Harriet Burrell. Had it not been for her we
undoubtedly should still be up in the trees in the
apple orchard.”
</p>
<p>
“Please tell us about it.”
</p>
<p>
“Please don’t,” begged Harriet blushingly.
</p>
<p>
“Now that you have aroused our curiosity,
it would be cruel not to tell us the whole story,”
declared George.
</p>
<p>
“Yeth. Cruelty to animalth,” nodded Tommy.
</p>
<p>
Miss Elting, despite Harriet’s protestations,
did tell the boys the story, giving the full credit
for their rescue to Harriet Burrell, to whom
it belonged. The boys listened in open-mouthed
wonder.
</p>
<p>
“Fellows, we aren’t so much as we think we
are,” declared the chief of the Tramp Club.
“I propose three cheers for Miss Burrell.
Now! Altogether! One, two, three!”
</p>
<p>
They gave three rousing cheers in which,
Tommy’s shrill voice joined.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span>
</p>
<p>
“Who’s all right?” demanded the captain at
the end of the cheer.
</p>
<p>
“Miss Burrell’s all right!” yelled the
Tramps. “For she’s a jolly good fel—low;
For she’s a jolly good fellow,” sang the Tramps,
as with hands on each other’s shoulders they
marched through the camp, and out into the
field on their way to their own camp, a short
distance from that of the Meadow-Brook Girls.
</p>
<p>
Miss Elting was laughing merrily. Harriet’s
face was crimson.
</p>
<p>
“I call that downright mean. They were
making fun of me.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, Harriet! You know they were not,”
rebuked Miss Elting. “It was the highest compliment
those lads could pay.”
</p>
<p>
“It hath been a day of experientheth, hathn’t
it?” Tommy questioned.
</p>
<p>
Harriet’s face was still flushed as she began
to prepare the supper. Each member of the
party now remembered that she had an appetite.
While they were getting the meal Jane
told them how the boys had gloated over having
“walked the girls off their feet,” as the
tramps expressed it. Jane announced triumphantly
that she had been more than a match for
them, which her companions could well believe,
for Jane had a sharp tongue, besides being the
possessor of a fund of Irish wit.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>
</p>
<p>
The smoke curling up from the other camp
told the girls that the boys were busy getting
their own supper. While eating, the guardian
was obliged to go over the story of their experiences
for the benefit of Jane, who interrupted
now and then with humorous questions.
</p>
<p>
“Are the boys coming over this evening?”
asked Margery, after they had finished supper
and she and Tommy were washing the dishes.
</p>
<p>
“They did not say,” called Hazel. “It is
safe to believe they will. I wonder if we can’t
get rid of those boys? They make me nervous.
It seems to me that they are perpetually
on the scene whether one wants to see them or
not.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t be hard on the poor Tramp Club,
Hazel,” laughed Harriet. “Remember you
might still be stuck fast in the swamp had they
not come to the rescue.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s so,” responded Hazel, with a sigh.
“I never thought of that. They’re really not
so bad after all.”
</p>
<p>
“I have met worse,” averred Harriet solemnly.
Whereupon there was a general laugh.
</p>
<p>
The tramps had gathered the fuel for the
Meadow-Brook Girls, stacking it up in piles of
various lengths. The lads really were trying
to make themselves useful to the young women.
As yet there had been no outward evidence of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span>
Captain Baker’s assertion that some of them
were “full of mischief.” The girls had piled
the campfire high with wood and gathered
about it when strains of music were heard.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, it ith a band, it ith a band,” cried
Tommy.
</p>
<p>
“Coming to serenade us, probably,” announced
Margery.
</p>
<p>
“No. I think it is some one playing on harmonicas,”
answered Miss Elting after a moment
of listening.
</p>
<p>
“It’s those boys,” groaned Hazel. “What
mischief are they up to now?”
</p>
<p>
“I told you. They are coming over to serenade
us. I think the serenade must be for
Harriet.”
</p>
<p>
“They are carrying something on their shoulders
too,” cried Harriet.
</p>
<p>
The girls, by this time, had run out to the
edge of the camp and in the faint twilight were
trying to make out what it was that the Tramp
Club were carrying. As the boys drew nearer,
the girls saw that it was a burlap sack. Four
boys were bearing the sack on their shoulders.
It appeared to be very heavy.
</p>
<p>
“Why, boys,” exclaimed Miss Elting. “Are
you moving?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, Miss Elting,” answered Captain Baker,
doffing his hat. “We are moving, in a sense.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span>
We have come prepared to lay the spoils of
our forage at the feet of beauty. Boys, dump
the bag. You know where.”
</p>
<p>
One of the boys untied the string by which
the mouth of the sack had been secured, then
the two lads at that end stepped from under.
Instantly the contents began rolling out at Harriet
Burrell’s feet.
</p>
<p>
“Muskmelons!” gasped the girls.
</p>
<p>
Great golden and green muskmelons bumped
to the ground. Harriet’s face was full of color.
</p>
<p>
“They—they aren’t all for me? Surely, you
don’t think I am equal to eating all of those?”
she gasped.
</p>
<p>
“They are laid at your feet,” answered
George dramatically. “For you and your
friends.”
</p>
<p>
“This is splendid,” declared the guardian,
her face aglow with pleasure. “But we do not
deserve so much. You have robbed yourselves.
Where did you get them?”
</p>
<p>
“Of a farmer,” replied George promptly.
</p>
<p>
“You must take most of them for yourselves,
boys,” urged Miss Elting. “We simply could
not eat half of all that lot.”
</p>
<p>
“No. They are all for you. We have plenty.
Besides, you’ll find some of them aren’t good,
but out of the lot you may be able to get enough
for breakfast.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span>
</p>
<p>
“We can eat all night if nethethary,” announced
Tommy. “Maybe we can eat them
all before we go on to-morrow.”
</p>
<p>
“One melon apiece will be quite enough for
us, my dears,” reproved Miss Elting. “Won’t
you join us in our feast, boys?”
</p>
<p>
The young men shook their heads.
</p>
<p>
“They’re yours,” replied the captain, his
eyes on Harriet as he said it. “I brought you
some salt, too,” he added, drawing a piece of
newspaper from his pocket. “Perhaps you like
salt on your melons.”
</p>
<p>
“You are very thoughtful,” smiled Miss
Elting. “I think we have salt. How about it,
Jane?”
</p>
<p>
“We have a whole bag of it.”
</p>
<p>
“We will take yours, thank you,” smiled
Harriet. “It is much finer salt than ours.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, it’s the salt the farmer over yonder
uses to give to his sheep,” interjected Sam.
“We borrowed some from him.”
</p>
<p>
Miss Elting laughed a little at this blunt
speech.
</p>
<p>
“You are very funny, boys!” she said. “But
we are grateful to you. I don’t know how we
shall be able to repay you.”
</p>
<p>
“We have shared your hospitality—your
bounteous hospitality,” answered the captain.
“We wished to make some slight return.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>
</p>
<p>
“What shall we do with what melons are
left over?” asked Miss Elting.
</p>
<p>
“Carry them on with you. You have a car
in which to transport your stuff.”
</p>
<p>
“I suppose we had better do that,” mused
the guardian. “When we reach the next camping
place we shall insist on entertaining you at
our camp. We greatly appreciate this treat.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you,” said George Baker, looking
somewhat embarrassed.
</p>
<p>
Shortly afterwards Captain Baker rose from
where he had been sitting and with an uneasy
look on his face announced that they must go.
With his fellows he hurriedly left the camp,
not even taking the melon sack along. They
were seen no more that night.
</p>
<p>
The girls noted Baker’s embarrassed manner
and thought it strange that the boys should
have left so abruptly. They were at a loss to
understand it.
</p>
<p>
“I am glad they have left the melons, anyway,”
declared Harriet.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, wasn’t that lovely of the boys to bring
the fruit to us?” nodded Miss Elting. “They
are really nice boys. I am rather glad that we
met them.”
</p>
<p>
“You may change your mind before we have
finished with them,” replied Harriet, with an
enigmatical smile.

<p>
“What do you mean, dear?”
</p>
<p>
“I can’t really explain. But I feel rather
than know that those young men are ready to
play tricks. They’d better not try any of them
or we shall make them regret that they ever
played tricks on the Meadow-Brook Girls.”
</p>
<p>
“Aren’t the melonth delithiouth?”
breathed Tommy. She was now eating her
second melon. The other girls were enjoying
theirs equally well.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” agreed Miss Elting. “The finest I
ever ate. They must have cost the boys quite
a sum of money, even though melons are cheap
in the country. I——”
</p>
<p>
“Thomebody ith coming,” warned Tommy.
</p>
<p>
“The boys are returning, I presume,” smiled
Miss Elting. But instead of the boys they were
surprised to see a strange man striding into
camp. He was plainly a farmer. He wore his
whiskers long and his trousers were tucked in
the tops of his boots. His face did not bear a
pleasant expression.
</p>
<p>
“So I’ve caught you at it, eh?” he said sarcastically.
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean?” demanded the guardian
rising hastily.
</p>
<p>
“You know well enough what I mean. In
the first place, you are trespassing on my premises.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>
</p>
<p>
“We have permission to camp here,” interjected
Jane.
</p>
<p>
“Who gave it?”
</p>
<p>
“The farmer who owns this land.”
</p>
<p>
“I happen to own this land, and I haven’t
given any tramps permission to camp on it.”
</p>
<p>
“Then some one must have played a trick
on me,” declared Crazy Jane. “Wait till I
get sight of that man again.”
</p>
<p>
“We are very sorry, sir, but we are wholly
innocent of trespassing. We are not tramps,
either. Of course we are willing to pay you
for the privilege of camping here to-night.
What do you consider a fair price?”
</p>
<p>
“Wal, I reckon about seventy-five cents will
be all right for the camping.”
</p>
<p>
Miss Elting handed the money over to him.
</p>
<p>
“I am sorry to have put you to all this
trouble, but we supposed we had permission
to stay here over night.”
</p>
<p>
“Thay,” questioned Tommy. “You are a
rich man, aren’t you?”
</p>
<p>
“No. Why?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, you thhould be.”
</p>
<p>
“By the way, ladies, there is another little
matter that you’ll have to fix up before we go
any further.”
</p>
<p>
The guardian and the girls glanced inquiringly
at their mercenary visitor.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean?”
</p>
<p>
“Them melons,” answered the farmer, indicating
the fruit with a nod.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t understand you, sir.” The guardian
was plainly perplexed. Harriet was smiling
broadly. She thought she understood now.
</p>
<p>
“The melons you stole from my field.”
</p>
<p>
“Stole from your field?” gasped Miss Elting.
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“Sir, you insult us! We have stolen neither
melons nor anything else. I demand that you
leave this camp instantly. We shall not endure
such accusations.”
</p>
<p>
“You didn’t steal them, eh?”
</p>
<p>
“No, we didn’t,” answered Jane, who had
stepped forward.
</p>
<p>
“Then where did you get them?”
</p>
<p>
The girls looked at one another. No one
spoke. None wished to place the blame on the
Tramp Club. The girls now began to understand
the hurried departure of Captain Baker
and his friends. Miss Elting saw that there
was only one course to pursue under the circumstances.
</p>
<p>
“I can’t tell you where we got the melons,
sir, but we didn’t steal them. How much are
the melons worth?”
</p>
<p>
“Why?” queried the farmer, scenting a bargain.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>
</p>
<p>
“We intend to pay for them,” answered Harriet
coldly.
</p>
<p>
“How many melons were there?” asked the
farmer, more blandly.
</p>
<p>
“Two dozen,” Harriet replied.
</p>
<p>
“That’ll be about four-eighty,” nodded the
farmer.
</p>
<p>
“But that’s——”
</p>
<p>
“It’s cheaper than the risk of going to jail,”
broke in the farmer meaningly.
</p>
<h2><a name='chXVII' id='chXVII'></a>CHAPTER XVII—TRYING OUT THE GIPSY TRAIL</h2>
<p>
The farmer pocketed the money that Miss
Elting handed him.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve my own opinion of you!” flared
Crazy Jane.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe you have,” chuckled the farmer,
“but——”
</p>
<p>
“You’re quite right,” Jane McCarthy
taunted. “You wouldn’t feel highly complimented
if I were to express that opinion!”
</p>
<p>
“If it’s that kind of an opinion——” muttered
the farmer, turning red under the coat
of tan on his face.
</p>
<p>
“It’s <em>worse</em>!” retorted Crazy Jane incisively.
</p>
<p>
Muttering under his breath, but failing to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span>
speak clearly, the abashed farmer turned on
his heel, striding away.
</p>
<p>
The humor of the situation now appealing
to them, the girls and their guardian began to
laugh heartily.
</p>
<p>
“Harriet, I believe you suspected this all the
time,” declared Miss Elting finally.
</p>
<p>
“Those boys looked mischievous. I didn’t
know what it was all about, but after a while,
I confess, I did suspect them. Never mind, I’ll
be even with them.”
</p>
<p>
“No, you leave it to me,” interjected Jane.
</p>
<p>
“I am glad that none of you girls betrayed
the boys,” declared Miss Elting approvingly.
“I would suggest that you say nothing to them
when we next see them. Let them introduce
the subject if it is introduced at all. They may
betray themselves. Tommy, don’t you lisp a
word of it.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t lithp,” retorted the little girl indignantly.
“I thpeak jutht like other folkth.”
</p>
<p>
“I did not mean it that way, dear,” laughed
the guardian. “I meant that you shouldn’t
mention our experience to any one. Now that
we have bought and paid for the melons I think
we had better stow them in the car. Come, let
us get ready for bed.”
</p>
<p>
“Are we to make an early start in the morning?”
asked Hazel.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes. We must not delay if we expect to
remain in the contest.”
</p>
<p>
The girls had no intention of giving up the
contest. They thought it possible that they
might have the company of the Tramp Club
on the morrow, as a good part of the Meadow-Brook
course lay over a highway, this being
the most direct route for the day’s tramping.
</p>
<p>
Rather to their surprise they discovered no
trace of the Tramp Club next day. The smoke
from the latter’s campfire was no longer visible
when the girls left their own camp in the morning,
nor was there any indication on the road
that the boys had passed over it. What the
girls did not know was that the boys had
slipped off into a ravine when the word had been
brought to them that the irate farmer was out
looking for the people who had visited his
melon patch. From there they had moved inland
and made a new camp. In the morning
they took a roundabout course, avoiding the
highway. It were better to be beaten by the
girls that day than to be caught by the angry
farmer. It was because of this longer route
that the Meadow-Brook Girls were again able
to get ahead of their rivals.
</p>
<p>
The tracks of Jane’s car had long since been
obliterated when the party neared the end of
the day’s journey. This did not trouble them,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>
for a certain definite stopping place had been
agreed upon, and as was customary, when following
the highway, the girls now and then
dropped a handful of grass in the road. Especially
was this done when they came to forks
in the road, so that in case Jane McCarthy returned
that way to look for them she might
see which direction they had taken. In doing
this, though the girls were unaware of the fact,
they were following a gipsy practice as old as
gipsies themselves. It was the gipsies’ way of
marking their trail for the benefit of others
of their kind who had straggled behind.
</p>
<p>
“I think this is the place,” decided Miss
Elting, halting, pointing down a narrow lane
that extended through a field of stunted bushes
and brush. The gate that had once shut off
this byway from the main road lay broken at
one side of it and a ridge of grass had grown
knee high in the middle of the lane. It was
a lane that had once led down to a cider mill
that now lay a heap of ruins.
</p>
<p>
“It ith thpooky-looking,” observed Tommy.
</p>
<p>
“Jane is here,” exclaimed Harriet. “I see
her car tracks, but I don’t see her car.”
</p>
<p>
“No; the car has come out onto the highway
and gone on,” Miss Elting declared. “Jane
must have driven to the next town to get something.
We will go down that lane.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>
</p>
<p>
Harriet dropped some grass in the road,
marking a trail into the byway to notify Jane
that they had arrived. They then made their
way down the lane. The girls were tired and
footsore. Walking in the road had been more
wearisome than tramping over the hills and
fields, perhaps because the former was less interesting
and more monotonous. It was therefore
a welcome sight when they espied the tent
that they called home, even though it was a now
weather-beaten and dingy-looking piece of canvas.
But Jane was nowhere in sight. Neither
was her car.
</p>
<p>
“Where can Jane be?” exclaimed Margery.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps this will explain matters,” replied
Miss Elting, taking down a sheet of writing
paper that had been pinned to the flap of the
tent. “Ah! Jane says she has gone on to the
town of Granite to meet her father, from whom
she got a letter this morning. She says she
may not be back until late, and that we shall
find the melons in the bushes to the west of
the tent.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t want any of those old melons,”
pouted Margery.
</p>
<p>
“I do,” retorted Tommy. “I’ll eat all I can
get.”
</p>
<p>
“At least, we have a right to eat them now
that we have paid for them,” smiled the guardian. “The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span>
first thing to do will be to heat
some water and bathe. We are all very dusty.
Tommy, you and Margery take your baths
first. In the meantime we will build the fire
and get the supper going. This is going to be
a pleasant camp. I wonder if we shall see our
friends, the boys, this evening?”
</p>
<p>
“Not if they see us first,” chuckled Harriet.
“Oh, what we won’t do to them when we get
the opportunity.”
</p>
<p>
“Jane must have had quite a time putting
up the tent without assistance,” remarked Miss
Elting. “She did it very well, too.”
</p>
<p>
Harriet was making the fire with Hazel’s
assistance, Tommy and Margery were preparing
for their baths. Twilight was upon them
before they realized it. By that time the supper
was cooking, the coffee steaming, the savory
odor of food filling the air about them. The
melons were reserved for the dessert. These
had ripened and were now soft, sweet and delicious.
</p>
<p>
“Girls, it is worth four dollars and eighty
cents to have such melons, isn’t it?” smiled
the guardian.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, indeed,” chorused the girls.
</p>
<p>
“I wonder what has become of the Tramp
Club,” mused Harriet.
</p>
<p>
“You will not see any more of the Tramps
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span>
for a while,” laughed Hazel. “It is a wonder
to me that we haven’t seen any real tramps
since we have been out on this trip. At potato-digging
time one usually sees a great many of
them.”
</p>
<p>
“We haven’t been on the road much, or perhaps
we should have seen more of them. That
is one advantage in keeping away from the
highways. One meets few live things in the
fields except the birds and occasionally sheep
and cattle.”
</p>
<p>
“Not to mention bulls,” finished Harriet
laughingly. “Speaking of tramps, I believe
I just saw one over yonder,” added the girl.
</p>
<p>
“Are you joking?” questioned the guardian.
</p>
<p>
For answer Harriet sprang up and ran toward
the tent. She did not reach it. She halted
sharply as a man stepped in front of her. He
was a typical follower of the road, dirty, unkempt
and evil looking.
</p>
<p>
“What do you want here?” demanded Harriet,
with a calmness that she was far from
feeling.
</p>
<p>
“Not much. We want some money and something
to eat,” leered the intruder.
</p>
<p>
“You will get neither here. What were you
doing in that tent? You came here to rob us.
Go away before we give you something you
won’t like.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span>
</p>
<p>
Miss Elting and Hazel sprang up, scattering
the tin dishes far and wide as they ran to Harriet’s
assistance, when three other men stepped
into view from the far side of the tent.
</p>
<p>
“If you folks will hand out your valuables,
and make no racket about it, we won’t hurt
you,” announced one of the newcomers. “What
we want is a little help, that’s all. We’re poor
fellows in distress. We ain’t the kind that rob
women. We ask for assistance.”
</p>
<p>
Miss Elting’s revolver was in the tent where
she could not reach it now. Had she had it with
her she would have assisted the men in a way
that they would not have liked. What to do
under the circumstances she did not know.
Neither Tommy nor Margery appeared able to
do anything. They were frightened nearly out
of their wits.
</p>
<p>
“You have a peculiar way of asking for assistance.
Had you come to us in the proper
manner we should have been glad to give you
something to eat. Now we shall not. Neither
have we money for you. I order you to go
away from here. If you refuse the consequences
will be on your own heads. We are
not quite so defenseless as you might think.
Will you go?”
</p>
<p>
The spokesman laughed. The spirit of the
girls appeared to amuse him. The fellow had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>
not the least idea that there was any other person
about. He, with his companions, had seen
the Meadow-Brook Girls come into the camp
alone. Not another person so far as they knew,
was within some miles of the place. They had
watched the camp and waited until dark to carry
out their plan of robbing the five women.
</p>
<p>
“Can you get it, do you think, Harriet?”
questioned Miss Elting in a low tone.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll try,” she answered. She knew what
the guardian meant. “It” meant Miss Elting’s
revolver. All at once the girl darted past the
man who stood directly in front of her. She
had almost reached the tent, when one of the
tramps caught hold of her by the shoulder.
Harriet was lithe and quick. She slipped from
his detaining clutch and sprang back. But her
opportunity was gone. The men partly divining
her purpose, had quickly blocked the entrance
to the tent. The leader nodded to one
of them to watch Tommy and Margery. Three
others directed their attention to Miss Elting,
Harriet and Hazel. They placed themselves in
such positions that the girls were hedged in.
To try to run would be to fall into the clutches
of one or another of the three ruffians who
were guarding them.
</p>
<p>
One of the men uttered a shrill whistle. Still
another tramp came running into the camp.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span>
</p>
<p>
“Turn out the tent in a hurry. Don’t take
anything that ain’t good. There’s money in
there somewhere. Now turn your pockets out,
ladies.”
</p>
<p>
His words were cut short by a long wailing
cry uttered by Harriet Burrell.
</p>
<p>
“Hoo-e-e-e-e! Hoo-e-e-e-e-e! Help, help!”
It was the call of the Meadow-Brook Girls, with
the warning cry for assistance added.
</p>
<p>
The man who had made the demand sprang
at her. Harriet leaped back. In doing so she
felt her arms pinioned by a second man. She
had forgotten for the moment that there were
guards behind her. Miss Elting suddenly found
her arms gripped from behind. She struggled
with all her strength. So did Harriet. Hazel
screamed as she felt her own arms pinioned.
</p>
<p>
“Herd the other two in the tent, then git all
the swag you can find,” commanded the
spokesman breathlessly, for he was having his
hands full helping his assistant to hold Miss
Elting and the two girls. One grasped Tommy
and Margery by their arms, and fairly dragging
them over, flung them into the tent. “Get
the stuff! Never mind those two. They’re too
scared to bother. It’s these that we’ve got to
look out for,” he directed.
</p>
<p>
“Hoo-e-e-e-e-e! Hoo-e-e-e-e-e! Help, help!”
screamed Harriet.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yell, Hazel!” gasped Harriet.
</p>
<p>
“I—I can’t! Oh, I can’t!” wailed Hazel.
</p>
<p>
Tommy found her voice at this juncture and
raised it in a piercing scream. A moment later
a blanket was twisted about her head and she
was flung into a corner, clawing and kicking.
Margery cowered at one side of the tent, too
frightened to move.
</p>
<p>
Just then a new note was sounded. From
behind the tent rose a shrill cry in a voice unfamiliar
to either the girls or to the thieving
tramps, a voice that caused the tramps to release
their prisoners and turn to face the owner
of the voice prepared for trouble.
</p>
<h2><a name='chXVIII' id='chXVIII'></a>CHAPTER XVIII—THE QUEEN TAKES A HAND</h2>
<p>
A strange figure stepped into the light
of the campfire. It was the figure of an
old woman, bent with age. Her face
was yellow and wrinkled, her eyes, black and
piercing. She hobbled a few steps toward
them, using a long stick as though for support.
</p>
<p>
“Out with you, villains!” she screamed,
brandishing the stick threateningly. “My
curses be upon your vile heads! Rob, would
you? You shall burn in the fire from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span>
clouds,” she hissed, pointing to the spokesman.
“And you,” pointing to another, “shall wither
in the pit with the iron doors, where all evil
doers shall come sooner or later. You shall
perish as you deserve. Sybarina says it. So
it shall be. Out with you!”
</p>
<p>
“It’s the Gipsy Queen,” screamed Hazel.
</p>
<p>
For a moment the tramps stood utterly
dumbfounded. They realized that the old
Gipsy was laying a curse upon them. More
or less superstitious, they stood in considerable
awe of Sybarina and her supposedly supernatural
powers. The tramp who had pinioned
Harriet’s arms behind her back involuntarily
relaxed his hold. Harriet made a dash for freedom.
In an instant her captor was at her heels.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t pay any attention to that old lunatic,”
he shouted to his companions. “She can’t hurt
you. Get the stuff and be quick about it.”
</p>
<p>
But he had reckoned without his host. Raising
her head, Sybarina sent a long shrill call
echoing across the fields. Even in the excitement
of the moment Harriet realized that it was
a signal. A second later the call was answered.
</p>
<p>
“Skip!” warned the leader of the tramps.
“It’s Gipsies. We’ll have the whole lot to fight
if we don’t light out!”
</p>
<p>
At this juncture five dark swarthy men came
running across the fields. With one accord the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span>
tramps took to their heels. The Gipsies started
in pursuit of them, but the tramps had a lead
of several yards and fear lending wings to their
feet, they soon outdistanced their pursuers who
finally abandoned the chase and returned to
where Sybarina stood, surrounded by the
Meadow-Brook Girls and their guardian.
</p>
<p>
Harriet sprang eagerly forward to thank
their rescuers, but Sybarina waved her aside.
Turning to the Gipsy men she spoke a few sharp
words in the Romany tongue. The men nodded,
talked among themselves for a moment then
turned and strolled off in the direction whence
they had come.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Sybarina!” cried Harriet disappointedly.
“Why didn’t you let me thank them for
chasing those tramps away?”
</p>
<p>
“I, their queen, have commended them. That
is sufficient,” returned Sybarina proudly.
“They need no thanks for obeying my commands.”
</p>
<p>
“Then we must thank you doubly,” smiled
Harriet, holding out her hand to the old Gipsy.
“What would we have done if you had not been
near?”
</p>
<p>
“It is well,” replied Sybarina earnestly, taking
Harriet’s hand in both of hers. “But you
must come with Sybarina. You must not stay
here alone this night. The bad men will return
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span>
again. But Sybarina’s men will stay here and
watch for them. You and your kind friends
will go with Sybarina to her camp.”
</p>
<p>
“But how did you happen to find us?” questioned
Miss Elting.
</p>
<p>
“Sybarina has eyes. Did those eyes not see
the patteran (trail of grass)? Did she not read
the message of the patteran that all of her tribe
know? Where did you learn to make the patteran
that leads the Gipsy toward the land
where the sun goes down?”
</p>
<p>
“She means the grass that we dropped in the
road,” explained Harriet.
</p>
<p>
The old woman nodded.
</p>
<p>
“The patteran,” she reiterated.
</p>
<p>
“Why,” laughed Harriet. “We did that so
that our friend Jane McCarthy would know
where we had gone.”
</p>
<p>
“Then there is Romany in your blood. None
but the people of the Romany would think of
such a thing. Where is the other princess?”
questioned the queen, glancing about.
</p>
<p>
“Miss McCarthy has gone to meet her
father,” Miss Elting informed the old woman.
“But we have not thanked you enough for the
great service that you have done us.”
</p>
<p>
“It is nothing. Did not the princess save
Sybarina’s miserable life? The debt is still unpaid.
Many summers will come, and many
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>
summers will go, ere the debt is paid. Sybarina
never will live to pay it. Her people will remember.
The Romany has a long memory,
princess. Come, pretty ladies, come to the
camp of the Gipsy. It is not good that you
should stay the night here. To-morrow night,
yes, but not this night.”
</p>
<p>
“What do you say, girls?” questioned Miss
Elting.
</p>
<p>
“Spend a night in a Gipsy camp?” asked
Harriet.
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“I think that would be fine.”
</p>
<p>
“But, Sybarina, what of our own camp? Will
not the men return and rob us?”
</p>
<p>
“I have told you. Sybarina’s people will be
on guard. You need have no fear. And when
the princess with the fair hair returns, she shall
be led to the Gipsy camp. Come.”
</p>
<p>
“Wait please, until we fix our camp and leave
a message for Miss McCarthy,” said Miss Elting.
</p>
<p>
So excited were the Meadow-Brook Girls at
the prospect of spending a night in a Gipsy
camp that they almost forgot the thrilling experiences
through which they had passed.
There were few preparations to be made. Miss
Elting pocketed her revolver, though she had
no idea that she would need it. She knew that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>
the old Gipsy woman might be trusted; that a
Gipsy never forgets a favor—nor a wrong.
Sybarina felt under deep obligations to them
for what they had done for her. By inviting
them to her camp she was conferring upon them
the highest possible mark of her regard, as the
guardian who knew something of the wandering
tribes of Gipsies was well aware.
</p>
<p>
The camp was some little distance from
where the Meadow-Brook tent was pitched. A
note for Jane was pinned to the tent flap on
the same spot where she had pinned hers; then
the party set out through the darkness. Not a
man of the tribe was to be seen. The guardian
asked no questions. She knew that Sybarina’s
word was law and that keen eyes were upon the
Meadow-Brook camp, that no marauders would
be permitted to enter there that night. Sybarina
led the way as if it were a familiar path, calling
out now and then to warn the travelers of
a root or a stone that lay unseen in the path
they were following. How she was aware of
the presence of the obstacles the girls could
not imagine.
</p>
<p>
They came in sight of the dull glow of the
Gipsy campfire after a quarter of an hour’s
walking. Then as they stepped into the circle
of light, many inquiring eyes were fixed upon
them. There were dark-eyed, olive-complexioned women
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span>
of various ages, children clad in
bright colors, some sitting under wagons eating
bread and butter, others peering from the
gaudily painted wagons, and still others lying
asleep upon the ground just outside the circle.
Horses might have been heard munching
at the foliage out in the bushes, occasionally
neighing or stamping. The fire crackled merrily.
It was a bright but unfamiliar scene to
the Meadow-Brook Girls.
</p>
<p>
Tommy and Margery were a trifle apprehensive.
</p>
<p>
“Where are we going to thleep?” questioned
Tommy cautiously.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know, dear,” returned Miss Elting.
“Sybarina will provide a place when the time
comes. We have our own blankets. I think we
may sleep out of doors if we wish to do so. But
we have a long evening before us yet. It is
your opportunity to learn something of the life
and habits of the Gipsies.”
</p>
<p>
“Thay, Mith Elting do—do you think it thafe
to thtay here?” questioned Tommy.
</p>
<p>
“Perfectly so. Much more so than in our
own camp this evening.”
</p>
<p>
Sybarina was brewing the tea with her own
hands. Miss Elting stepped over to her.
</p>
<p>
“May I assist you?” she asked.
</p>
<p>
The Gipsy queen shook her head.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span>
</p>
<p>
“Sybarina will make the tea for her friends,
her good friends, the pretty ladies. Sybarina
will have other guests this evening.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, will you?” questioned the guardian, in
a surprised tone.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. Pretty ladies will come to cross the
Gipsy’s palm with silver. Sybarina will read
the future and the past for them. Sybarina will
read your future too, but you and your friends
need not cross her palm with silver. Sybarina is
your friend.”
</p>
<p>
Harriet had been an interested listener to the
brief dialogue. She drew a little closer.
</p>
<p>
“I should like to learn to read the past and
future, Sybarina. Will you teach me?” asked
Harriet.
</p>
<p>
The old woman fixed her piercing eyes upon
the eager face before her.
</p>
<p>
“The princess shall be taught to read the future
this very night. The stars have said it.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m afraid I never could learn to read palms
in one night,” laughed Harriet.
</p>
<p>
“The stars and the voices of the air will help
you. Be not afraid. But you must be a Gipsy
true.”
</p>
<p>
“How do you mean?”
</p>
<p>
“You must be like other Gipsies.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! You mean dress like them?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. After the tea you shall see.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span>
</p>
<p>
Tea was a most formal affair. Sybarina first
took a sip from her own cup then passed the
cup to the others, each girl taking a sip in turn,
after which cups were served to each member
of the party. By this time the other members
of the tribe appeared to have lost interest in
the visitors.
</p>
<p>
“My girls would know something of your people,
Sybarina,” suggested Miss Elting after the
formalities of the tea drinking had been finished
and the girls had settled down to their own cups
of tea.
</p>
<p>
She regarded her teacup frowningly, as
though she were seeking light in the amber fluid.
</p>
<p>
“My daughters,” said the old woman. “It
takes many years to earn the confidence of a
Romany. You have done so in a hour. All are
Gorgios to the Gipsy.”
</p>
<p>
“What ith a Gorgio?” piped Tommy.
</p>
<p>
“Any one not Romany is a Gorgio. Forever
has the Gorgio hounded the Gipsy. The Gorgio
thinks the Gipsy a thief, but the Gipsy is not a
thief. The Gipsy has little history, my
daughters, but the Gipsy dates back to antiquity,
to the famed Kings of Egypt. He keeps
his sacred tongue—the Romany. It is his secret
language. Through it he can hold converse
with the Romanys of the world. Ages and ages
ago, the Romany was called a Jat. That was in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span>
far off India. Then came a bad king from Persia
who stole ten thousand of them to make
music for him. There they remained until nine
hundred years after the Son of Man came, when
they were taken captive again and held in bondage
until at last they separated and journeyed
to the far places of the world. To-day the
Gipsy is the only free man who wanders the
earth. He pays no tithes, he has no cares.”
</p>
<p>
“But you have a ruler, a head of all the Gipsies,
have you not?” interjected Miss Elting.
</p>
<p>
“There is the queen of all,” answered the
old woman softly. “She now is one hundred
years old. She lives in Roumania. Each year
are her commands received by all her peoples
throughout the world. How, I cannot tell you.
It is a secret of the Romanys. We love, we
hate, but not as do the Gorgios. But see! The
princess has returned. She seeks her friends.”
</p>
<p>
“You—you mean Miss McCarthy?” questioned
Harriet.
</p>
<p>
The Gipsy nodded gravely.
</p>
<p>
“Good grathiouth,” exclaimed Tommy.
“Thhe’th got eyeth in the top of her head. How
doeth thhe know that Jane hath come back?”
</p>
<p>
“I read the message in the teacup,” answered
Sybarina. “It is time, fair daughter to begin,
if you would read the secrets of the stars. Come
with me and you shall be prepared.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span>
</p>
<p>
Harriet rose and followed the old woman
to one of the gaudily painted wagons, without
the slightest hesitancy.
</p>
<h2><a name='chXIX' id='chXIX'></a>CHAPTER XIX—DELVING INTO THE MYSTERIES</h2>
<p>
“Oh, good gracious! Where are they?”
cried Crazy Jane, as she walked into
the Gipsy camp.
</p>
<p>
The girls glanced at each other wonderingly.
Had not the Gipsy queen just told them that
Jane had arrived at the Meadow-Brook camp?
The mystery was too great for them to solve.
</p>
<p>
“But darlin’s, what does it mean? The Gipsy
girl who came for me, said you were staying
here for the night.”
</p>
<p>
“We have been invited to be the guests of
the tribe for this night, Jane. Sybarina is the
queen of these Gipsies, you know. She is the
one we rescued from the burning barn.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course. Why are you here?”
</p>
<p>
The guardian explained how they had been
attacked by tramps and how the Gipsy woman
and her companions had come to their rescue.
</p>
<p>
Jane was amazed, then her face flushed with
anger. She wanted to know if the Tramp Club
had been seen. Miss Elting said they had not.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span>
</p>
<p>
“But where is my darlin’ Harriet?” questioned
Jane, gazing at her inquiringly.
</p>
<p>
“She has gone with the queen into one of the
wagons. You will see her soon.”
</p>
<p>
“Won’t it be jolly, Jane, to spend a night in
a Gipsy camp?” cried Hazel.
</p>
<p>
“Well, that depends. I’ve heard the tribes
weren’t overly clean.”
</p>
<p>
“Sh-h-h!” warned Miss Elting. “You
mustn’t say such things here. Remember we are
guests.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m not likely to forget it. Oh, look at that
pretty Gipsy girl! What a beauty!” cried Jane
delightedly.
</p>
<p>
The Gipsy girl who had emerged from one of
the wagons was indeed pretty. Her hands were
demurely folded, her head lowered, and her eyes
veiled by drooping lashes, as she moved slowly
toward the group. She came to a halt directly
in front of Crazy Jane.
</p>
<p>
“Cross my palm with silver and I’ll read
your past and your future,” invited the pretty
Gipsy girl.
</p>
<p>
Crazy Jane leaned forward regarding the
Gipsy girl with keen, searching eyes.
</p>
<p>
“Indeed I will. Yes, darlin’, you can read my
future and my past. How much silver shall I
cross your palm with?”
</p>
<p>
“What you will, pretty lady.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span>
</p>
<p>
Jane placed a shining fifty cent piece on the
open palm. Something about the palm appeared
to interest her very much. Just at this
juncture, the Gipsy girl chanced to look up. The
eyes of the two girls met. Jane uttered a whoop
and embraced the girl in a bearlike hug.
</p>
<p>
“If it isn’t my own darlin’ Harriet,” she
cried. “But who would have thought it. Hurrah
for Harriet, the Gipsy!”
</p>
<p>
“Ah, daughter, she is the true Romany,” interrupted
Sybarina, suddenly appearing behind
Harriet. “None but a true daughter of
Romany could have said those words so well.”
The old woman’s eyes gleamed with pride.
Then she exclaimed: “I see strangers coming to
the camp of the Gipsy! Would you have them
see you, or would you watch them from the
wagons?”
</p>
<p>
“From the wagons,” chorused the girls.
</p>
<p>
“The Romany princess, she of the brown
eyes, may wander at will. The strangers will
not think her a Gorgio. She is a true Romany.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you, Sybarina, I will go with my
friends. Perhaps I may come out later,” answered
Harriet. She was dressed in Gipsy
costume, and her face, already dark, had been
slightly stained with herbs which the old woman
had rubbed on both her face and hands.
</p>
<p>
The young men and women from nearby
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span>
farms began to stroll into the camp to have their
fortunes told. With them came several keen-eyed
farmers, leading horses which they had
brought in for a chance at a trade. The Gipsy
men quickly gathered about the animals, then
began the incessant talk of the horse trader,
the Gipsies being particularly shrewd in that
line of business. In the meantime Sybarina
and several other women of the tribe were reading
the futures of the giggling country girls.
It was all very interesting to the girls in the
nearby wagon. They were peering out from
the darkened interior, unseen. Never before
had they experienced anything so romantic or
so picturesque.
</p>
<p>
Harriet finally wandered out into the field.
She attracted attention only because of her
slender figure and pretty face. She had no fear
of being recognized, for no one there ever had
seen her before.
</p>
<p>
“Isn’t she a typical Gipsy, though?”
chuckled Jane, gazing admiringly at Harriet.
</p>
<p>
“Unless one knew she were not, one couldn’t
tell the difference,” answered Miss Elting.
“Just look at that girl for whom the queen is
telling a fortune. See how eagerly she drinks
in every word. Every word is true to her. She
believes it all.”
</p>
<p>
“So does Sybarina,” replied Hazel.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210'></a>210</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I think she does. Do you know, Jane,
she told us when you arrived at the tent. I
think it must have been at the moment when you
reached there. I can’t imagine how she knew.”
</p>
<p>
“Maybe she heard the car,” suggested Margery.
</p>
<p>
“No she didn’t,” declared Jane. “I drove
into the camp without making a sound. I
wanted to give you a surprise. I wonder how
she knew I was near.”
</p>
<p>
Neither Jane nor any of her companions had
thought of the big headlights on the car, the
glint of which had flashed on the foliage of
a tree near the gipsy camp just as Jane was
swinging into the byway that led down to the
Meadow-Brook camp. Perhaps the old gipsy’s
keen eyes had caught this flash and read it
aright. But this the girls were never to know.
Their attention, just now, was attracted by the
sound of loud talking. Voices were heard approaching
the camp.
</p>
<p>
“I guess we are going to have quite a party
this evening,” said Harriet, stepping into the
wagon. “Oh, this is simply great! What a
pity we aren’t all made up to look like Gipsies.”
</p>
<p>
“Look, girls!” exclaimed the guardian.
</p>
<p>
They did look, with widening eyes.
</p>
<p>
“My grathiouth, if it ithn’t thothe Tramp
boyth,” breathed Tommy.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211'></a>211</span>
</p>
<p>
“It certainly is the Tramp Club. There’s
Captain Baker and Sammy and Dill and Davy.
Where could they have come from?” wondered
Hazel.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, let’s go out and call to them,” suggested
Margery enthusiastically.
</p>
<p>
“Wait,” warned Harriet. “I have a plan
that I think will work to perfection. If it does,
we’ll have some fun with the Tramp Club this
evening.”
</p>
<p>
“What is it, darlin’?”
</p>
<p>
Harriet whispered in Jane’s ear. Crazy Jane
uttered a loud laugh.
</p>
<p>
“Sh-h-h!” warned the guardian. “You will
betray our hiding place to those boys.”
</p>
<p>
“I must get word to Sybarina. I wish she
would come over here,” mused Harriet.
</p>
<p>
As though in answer to her wish, Sybarina
rose and hobbled toward the wagon. She halted
at the step without looking up.
</p>
<p>
“The friends of the pretty ladies are here.
What do the pretty ladies wish to do?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Sybarina! I want to read the future
for that boy yonder on the right, the one with
the reddish hair. May I? Please let me.”
</p>
<p>
“It shall be as the Romany girl wishes, but
she must be grave, she must not make her real
self known to the laughing boy.”
</p>
<p>
“No, no, no! I promise not to betray my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span>
identity. But what shall I say? I don’t know
what to say,” begged Harriet.
</p>
<p>
“The words will come unbidden to the lips
of the Romany girl. Fear not. Come.” There
was a suspicion of a twinkle in the piercing
black eyes as Sybarina stretched forth her hand
to Harriet Burrell. Harriet’s heart thumped
violently as she stepped down from the wagon.
“If I get a chance to read George Baker’s palm
I will make him stand as near to the wagon as
possible, so you girls can hear what I say to
him, but don’t you dare make a sound.”
</p>
<p>
“Isn’t she the clever darlin’?” chuckled
Crazy Jane.
</p>
<p>
“Harriet is a very resourceful girl,” answered
Hazel admiringly.
</p>
<p>
“Yes; Harriet has added a good many honor
beads to her string during this hike,” replied
the guardian. “I think, too, that she is going
to pay those boys the debt that we owe them.”
</p>
<p>
“Listen!” commanded Jane. Sybarina was
speaking.
</p>
<p>
“Behold before you the Star of the East.
Behold one who has come out of the East to
read the future true. Cross her palm with
silver and the Oracle will speak, revealing the
past and foretelling the future.”
</p>
<p>
The Gipsy queen had not led Harriet into
the bright light. Instead the girl, in the fainter
light at the outer edge of the circle, stood with
downcast eyes, hands folded before her.
</p>

</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215'></a>215</span></div>
<p>
“Who shall be the first to hear the future
and the past from the Star of the East?”
</p>
<p>
“Say, fellows, now is the time to find out a
few things,” laughed Captain George Baker.
“Here’s where I consult the Star of the East.
Here, young woman, read my palm. I don’t
know anything about this fortune-telling business,
and I don’t believe in it, but I’m willing
to take a chance on it. How much does it cost
to consult the stars?”
</p>
<p>
“For a silver quarter I will reveal the past
only. Cross my hand with a silver dollar and
both the past and future shall be as an open
book,” answered Harriet, speaking in a low
tone, disguising her voice as much as possible.
</p>
<p>
George uttered a low whistle.
</p>
<p>
“A dollar! Whew! Isn’t that pretty high?”
</p>
<p>
“The stars are higher,” was the curt reply
of the Star of the East.
</p>
<p>
There was an audible giggle from the interior
of the nearby wagon. Harriet heard it,
but Captain Baker was too much interested in
the prospect of having his fortune told to give
heed to the sound.
</p>
<p>
“Isn’t she the clever darlin’?” reiterated
Crazy Jane, restraining herself from shouting
only by a great effort of will.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216'></a>216</span>
</p>
<p>
“All right. Here’s your money. But, mind
you, I’ll expect a lot of information for a dollar.”
</p>
<p>
“The past and future are not measured by
silver,” retorted Harriet. “That which is past
the Oracle has revealed to me. That which is
to be, I alone can tell. I am but the mouthpiece
of the Oracle, but the Oracle cannot lie.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m glad to be assured of hearing the truth,
at any rate,” replied George flippantly.
</p>
<p>
“Be at rest. You shall hear the truth,”
promised the Star of the East dryly. Then
taking George’s hand in hers she gravely scrutinized
the lines of his palm.
</p>
<p>
“The lines of your hand tell me many
things,” she began.
</p>
<p>
“Then be sure that you tell me all about
them. I want my money’s worth,” urged the
captain.
</p>
<p>
“The past and future shall be fully revealed
to you,” promised the supposed Gipsy. Captain
George Baker of the Tramp Club then listened
to a fortune that, though it did not wholly
please, amazed him beyond measure.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217'></a>217</span><a name='chXX' id='chXX'></a>CHAPTER XX—GETTING EVEN WITH GEORGE</h2>
<p>
“Your hand tells me that you travel not
alone,” continued Harriet. “Other
youths are with you. Together you
have journeyed for many days along the highway.”
</p>
<p>
“Well? That’s nothing. Anybody could
see that,” jeered George.
</p>
<p>
“If you would listen to the word of the
Oracle, be silent. On your journey, maidens
have crossed your path. They, too, are wayfarers
along the trail. You have held out the
hand of fellowship to them, but your friendship
is false and your hearts are full of guile.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s just where you’re wrong,” interrupted
George. “Those girls are all right and
we like them a lot. I’d like to know how you
know so much about them.”
</p>
<p>
“The Gipsy knows many things,” replied
Harriet enigmatically. “Your hand reveals to
her the grievous wrong you have done these
trusting maidens.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, that’s not so,” contradicted George.
</p>
<p>
“None can deceive the Oracle,” was the stern
answer. “I see here a camp. The campfire
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218'></a>218</span>
burns brightly. About it sit the maidens.
Look! Six youths approach. With them they
bear a sack filled with the melons of the field.
The maidens welcome them with smiles and
pleasant words. They little know whence came
these melons. They little know that before
them lies the bitter fruit of lawless thievery.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, that’s putting it altogether too strong,”
expostulated George. “How can you tell anything
about where those melons came from by
the lines of my hand?”
</p>
<p>
“To the Prophet of the Oracle all things are
plain,” replied the Star of the East. “In the
early darkness of the night, ere the moon rose,
the evildoers stole forth, and robbed the farmer
of his melons.”
</p>
<p>
“This is becoming too personal,” gasped
George, mopping his forehead.
</p>
<p>
“Word was brought to the farmer of this
wicked deed and he hurried forth to catch the
thieves,” continued Harriet. “Long did he
search for them. Then seeing the camp of the
maidens he approached, and finding them innocently
eating his melons, he poured forth the
vials of his wrath upon their defenseless heads.
He branded them as thieves and demanded settlement.
They crossed the farmer’s palm with
much silver to pay for the stolen melons. They
were too noble to betray the real thieves.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219'></a>219</span>
</p>
<p>
Captain George shifted uneasily. “That’s
really too bad. I’m sorry they got into such
a mess,” he muttered. “I wonder what they
think of us.”
</p>
<p>
“Their hearts are filled with shame and sorrow
at the deceitfulness of those whom they
supposed were their friends.”
</p>
<p>
“But—but the boys didn’t intend to make
trouble for the girls,” protested the captain.
“They thought it would be great fun to forage
for melons, and at the same time to give the
girls a treat.”
</p>
<p>
The supposed gipsy shook her head slowly.
</p>
<p>
“It makes no difference what they thought.
The deed is done. There is only one way in
which the wrong can be righted.”
</p>
<p>
“How can these boys square themselves with
the girls?” questioned George eagerly.
</p>
<p>
“I will consult the Oracle.” The Gipsy girl
stood with head bent as though in deep thought.
Then she said solemnly: “If the wicked boys
will go to those whom they have so cruelly
wronged and ask pardon for their unmanly behavior
perhaps forgiveness may be theirs.”
</p>
<p>
“I—I guess I’d better,” returned George earnestly.
At this juncture a smothered giggle
from the darkened Gipsy wagon came near
breaking up the seance. He glanced up suspiciously.
Harriet’s face was grave.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220'></a>220</span>
</p>
<p>
“You have chosen wisely. Will you obey the
command of the Oracle?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, ye—es. I’ll apologize. I’ll do it. It’s
wonderful. I never thought there was so much
to fortune telling.”
</p>
<p>
“There is more to it than you dream,” answered
Harriet Burrell, and with much truth
on her side. There was indeed more to it than
Captain George Baker dreamed. In the Gipsy
wagon four girls and their guardian were making
desperate efforts to control their laughter
that the sounds of their merriment might not
be heard by the young man outside.
</p>
<p>
“Can you answer any question I ask you?”
queried George, after thinking deeply.
</p>
<p>
“The Oracle knows all things, if it will but
speak,” answered the Gipsy girl, leaving an
avenue of escape if he should ask her something
that she was unable to answer.
</p>
<p>
“Where are the girls now?”
</p>
<p>
“They are near at hand. Would you see
them?”
</p>
<p>
“No, no. Not to-night,” hastily interposed
Captain Baker. “What I wish to know is
where they are.”
</p>
<p>
“You would know if they have outwitted
you in the race?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, yes. But how do you know what I am
thinking about?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221'></a>221</span>
</p>
<p>
“The mouthpiece of the Oracle knows all
things,” crooned the fortune teller. “No, they
have not yet won the race. You shall see them
on the morrow.”
</p>
<p>
“Where? Tell me where?”
</p>
<p>
“A short span of twelve miles hence there
is a spring. The spring is known as Granite
Spring.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, yes? Will they be there?” he asked
eagerly.
</p>
<p>
“No, not there,” replied the Gipsy. “But you
will find them near at hand. Seek and you shall
find, but go with humble spirit, else disaster
may overtake you.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you, I’ll do as you say. This is wonderful.
I want my friends to have their fortunes
told by you. You are the right kind. I
wonder if you can tell me just what these girls
are going to do to get ahead of us in the race.”
</p>
<p>
“I will consult the Oracle once more,” replied
the fortune teller.
</p>
<p>
It was fully two minutes before Harriet
raised her head. George stood eagerly awaiting
her answer.
</p>
<p>
“The Oracle knows but will not say,” replied
Harriet coldly. “The Oracle is ever fair and
just. It will not reveal the plans of the maidens
to their enemies. The Star of the East is weary.
She cannot read the palms of your friends.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222'></a>222</span>
Your way lies yonder. Your companions await
you.”
</p>
<p>
Captain George, very red of face, a sheepish
expression in his eyes, got up hastily and
walked over to his companions who were sitting
on the ground awaiting him.
</p>
<p>
“Come on, fellows. Let’s get out of here.
This place gives me the creeps.”
</p>
<p>
“You seemed mighty interested in what that
Gipsy girl had to say. Did she tell you anything
remarkable?” asked Dill laughingly.
</p>
<p>
“Did she? I should say she did.”
</p>
<p>
“Then you did better than the rest of us.
That other young Gipsy woman didn’t tell me
a single thing.”
</p>
<p>
“The old Gipsy woman gave it to me red
hot!” exclaimed Sam. “She told me some
things I’d just as soon not have heard. She
said I was started on the road to thievery. Now
what do you think of that?”
</p>
<p>
“That’s nothing,” replied George. “The
young one told me all about it.”
</p>
<p>
“About what?” questioned Davy.
</p>
<p>
“That melon business.”
</p>
<p>
“You don’t mean it?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I do. She told me about the whole
affair.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, what do you think of that?” wondered
Fred.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223'></a>223</span>
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t think much of it.”
</p>
<p>
“How do you suppose she found out about
it?”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t ask me,” replied George gloomily.
“She said that the Oracle told her.”
</p>
<p>
“You don’t believe such nonsense as that,
do you?” asked Davy.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know what to think about it. Gipsies
are queer folks. They’re too mysterious to suit
me. I’ve got all I want of them. They know
too much,” declared the captain. “Why, they
can read one’s thoughts.”
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, Harriet gleefully watched
the departure of the boys from the camp.
There was laughter in her eyes. She turned
to the wagon where her companions were now
giving expression to uncontrolled merriment.
Few visitors remained in the camp, and these
were some distance away.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I think I have evened up matters with
that young man,” declared Harriet. “What
do you say, girls?” she asked, thrusting a laughing
face into the wagon.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Harriet!” gasped Miss Elting. “It
was the funniest thing I ever heard. And he
believed every word of it.”
</p>
<p>
“Why shouldn’t he? It was the truth. By
the way, Miss Elting—I have collected one dollar
of that four dollars and eighty cents that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224'></a>224</span>
you paid for the melons,” said Harriet, extending
a hand in the palm of which lay Captain
Baker’s silver dollar.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no, no,” protested the guardian, drawing
back. “I could not think of accepting the
money.”
</p>
<p>
“Why not? I can collect the whole amount in
a very short time at this rate,” laughed Harriet.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, darlin’! What a girl, what a girl!”
laughed Crazy Jane.
</p>
<p>
“No. You must not keep it. It does not
rightfully belong to you.”
</p>
<p>
“Then if you refuse to accept the money I
shall give it to Sybarina. She’ll take it. Trust
a Gipsy to take everything that is offered.”
</p>
<p>
Sybarina graciously accepted the money. Her
eyes shone as she hobbled over to Harriet Burrell
and exclaimed earnestly: “I said you were
the true Romany. Now I know it. Did I not
tell you the power to foretell both the past and
future would come to you unbidden?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” laughed Harriet, “but I happened to
know considerable about the Tramp Club’s affairs
particularly since they visited a certain
melon patch. Is there any danger of those boys
returning to-night?”
</p>
<p>
Sybarina shook her head. “They have returned
to their camp.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225'></a>225</span>
</p>
<p>
“Where are they camping?”
</p>
<p>
“On yonder hillside. Even now you can catch
the glow of their campfire. But you shall see
them again and you shall make them red of face
for the trick which they played on you and your
friends, my Romany girls. You would outwit
them?”
</p>
<p>
“We are trying to get home ahead of them.”
</p>
<p>
The old woman nodded.
</p>
<p>
“The way shall be made clear to you. Sybarina
will tell the Romany girl how to defeat
her rivals, to show them that the Romany tribes
know the secret bypaths as the birds know the
trail to the sunny land when the frost is in the
air. Come, child. Come, sit by the fire, while
Sybarina tells you that which shall make the
way clear.”
</p>
<h2><a name='chXXI' id='chXXI'></a>CHAPTER XXI—HARRIET PLANS TO OUTWIT THE TRAMP CLUB</h2>
<p>
A long conversation was held between
Harriet and the Gipsy queen, the latter
drawing a map on the ground with a
willow wand to show the girl the route that she
was to travel after the Meadow-Brook Girls had
gone on for another day.
</p>
<p>
Harriet’s eyes were sparkling. She thought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226'></a>226</span>
she saw a way to outwit the Tramp Club. Harriet
was chuckling gleefully when she joined
her companions. She declined to tell them that
night, however, just what the Gipsy had communicated
to her.
</p>
<p>
“Where shall we sleep to-night?” asked Miss
Elting.
</p>
<p>
“Sybarina says we may have the wagon to
sleep in,” answered Harriet. “Shall we use
it?”
</p>
<p>
“No. I think I prefer to sleep in the open,”
answered the guardian. “It is not a cool night.
Suppose we roll up in our blankets and sleep
by the campfire? What do you say, girls?”
</p>
<p>
“I thay yeth,” spoke up Tommy. “I’ll put
my feet againtht the fire; then I won’t have cold
feet any more.”
</p>
<p>
They were sound asleep in a few moments
after turning in. Even the Gipsy dogs that had
been barking most of the evening, and the crying
babies, to whom none of the tribe had given
the slightest heed, were now quietly asleep.
Sybarina watched her guests roll up in their
blankets and nodded approvingly.
</p>
<p>
“The true Romany,” she muttered. For a
long time the old woman sat by the fire, sat until
the embers fell together and the sticks began to
blacken, when she rose and peered into each
sleeping face of the Meadow-Brook Girls. Sybarina
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227'></a>227</span>
then hobbled to her own wagon and disappeared
within.
</p>
<p>
The Meadow-Brook Girls awakened next
morning with the sun in their eyes. Miss Elting
sat up and called softly to Harriet. The
guardian and Harriet rubbed their eyes and
blinked dazedly about them. There was something
strange about their surroundings, but just
what that strangeness was they for the moment
did not know. All at once they discovered what
had happened. They were absolutely alone,
save for their sleeping companions.
</p>
<p>
“Why, they’ve gone!” cried Harriet.
</p>
<p>
“Gone and we never woke up,” laughed Miss
Elting. “How strange.”
</p>
<p>
“Who hath gone?” mumbled Tommy, sitting
up.
</p>
<p>
“The Gipsies,” answered Harriet.
</p>
<p>
“They must have left in a great hurry, for
some reason,” suggested the guardian. “I
don’t understand it. Nor do I understand how
they managed to slip away so quietly.”
</p>
<p>
The wagon tracks were plainly outlined in the
soft earth and the remnants of the campfire
were there, but that was all. Yet it was not all.
As Harriet sought to draw on her shoe she felt
something hard in the toe. Groping in the shoe
with her fingers she drew forth a tightly
wrapped paper. Opening this she found a tiny
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228'></a>228</span>
brass triangle. On it were crudely cut several
strange characters.
</p>
<p>
“How curious,” breathed Harriet. “But how
did it get in my shoe?” she wondered.
</p>
<p>
“Look on the wrapping paper,” suggested
Miss Elting.
</p>
<p>
Harriet did so. As she looked the puzzled
expression on her face gave place to a smile.
</p>
<p>
“It is from Sybarina,” she exclaimed. “This
is what she writes: ‘A charm for the Romany
girl. No harm shall come to her who wears it.
Happiness and prosperity shall be hers forever
and always. It is the Gipsy good luck charm.
Who knows but that, some day, you may wear
it as a queen? Farewell until we meet again.’”
</p>
<p>
“How strange!” murmured Harriet, holding
up the trinket that her companions might see.
</p>
<p>
“I wonder if it ith a charm againtht bullth?”
piped Tommy.
</p>
<p>
“I would suggest, girls, that we return to our
own camp. It may not be there by this time.”
</p>
<p>
Upon reaching their own camp they were
much relieved to find everything as it should
be. Nothing had been disturbed. But, ere they
had finished their breakfast, three farmers came
striding in to know if anything had been seen
of the Gipsies.
</p>
<p>
“They left early this morning,” answered
Miss Elting. “Why?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229'></a>229</span>
</p>
<p>
“Wal, nothing only one of them traded off
on me a ring-boned, spavined old hoss, which
he said was sound. I’ll catch them when they
come this way again.”
</p>
<p>
“I think I understand why the Gipsies took
such an early departure,” said Harriet after
the men had gone. “But I do not believe Sybarina
had anything to do with such dishonest
dealing.”
</p>
<p>
The day’s route was laid out after breakfast.
The boys undoubtedly had gone on, for nothing
was to be seen of their campfire. Miss Elting
rather thought they would see no more of the
Tramp Club after the fortune-telling that Harriet
had given the chief the night before. But
with the route that Sybarina had laid out for the
girls, the guardian believed they could make
some time and gain the advantage over the boys.
</p>
<p>
Camp was hurriedly struck after breakfast.
Their route that day lay across lots and their
camping place was to be on the edge of a forest
easily accessible to Jane with her motor car.
Using government maps, as they were doing,
they were able to locate every little rise of
ground, every hollow and almost every clump
of bushes along their way. These government
maps Miss Elting had purchased at a comparatively
small cost, as any one may do. They are
very useful to one who is taking a tramp
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230'></a>230</span>
through the country, and the Meadow-Brook
Girls found them so.
</p>
<p>
Jane accompanied her companions out to the
highway and followed along behind them in her
car for the first mile. Then their ways parted,
the tramping girls to climb a hill, Crazy Jane
to follow the highway on to the point where she
too was to leave the road and make camp for
them. But there was always a long wait for
Jane, so the girl occupied the time in driving
to the nearest village to make a number of purchases
at the stores.
</p>
<h2><a name='chXXII' id='chXXII'></a>CHAPTER XXII—A COMBIETTA CONCERT</h2>
<p>
Her shopping done Jane lost no time in
cranking up her car, hopped in and
with a wave of her hand swung down
the road and went honking through the village
on the way to the place chosen for the Meadow-Brook
Girls’ camp for that night. Jane had
avoided all questions about herself and her
party, except to say that they were camping.
The girl did not propose to leave a trail for the
Tramp Club if she could avoid it. As the girls
were nearing the end of their journey it behooved
them to cloak their movements with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231'></a>231</span>
secrecy if they hoped to outwit their young rivals
and win the race, which they were determined
to do.
</p>
<p>
Jane had pitched the tent just within the edge
of the woods and had started a small cook-fire
when the welcome “hoo-e-e-e” of the Meadow-Brook
Girls first reached her ears. She ran out
into the open waving her apron and shouting a
welcome.
</p>
<p>
“There she is,” cried Margery.
</p>
<p>
“Dear old Jane!” exclaimed Hazel. “She has
gotten everything ready for us and started a
fire.”
</p>
<p>
“I propose three cheers for Jane McCarthy,”
cried Harriet. The cheers were given in the
shrillest tones of the Meadow-Brook Girls. Jane
bowed in exaggerated fashion at this ovation.
</p>
<p>
“Have you seen the boys to-day, Jane?” was
Harriet’s first question.
</p>
<p>
“Not a sign of them, the rascals,” replied
Jane.
</p>
<p>
“I imagine that they are at Granite Spring,
half a dozen miles back,” laughed Harriet.
</p>
<p>
“What makes you think so?” asked Hazel.
</p>
<p>
“Because, when I read Captain Baker’s fortune,
I told him that our next camping place
was to be not far from that place. He will make
straight for Granite Spring, you see if he
doesn’t.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232'></a>232</span>
</p>
<p>
“Then I don’t think we’ll see the lads again
this trip,” concluded Jane. “But, girls,
you’ve got to get busy if you hope to win this
contest. Three more days of hiking will bring
you to Meadow-Brook. If the boys once get
ahead of you, you can’t expect to catch up with
them and win in that length of time.”
</p>
<p>
“We simply must win, Jane,” returned Harriet
determinedly.
</p>
<p>
“Then you’d better begin to think about how
you’re going to do it,” advised Jane dryly.
</p>
<p>
“Jane is right,” agreed the guardian. “We
must plan to-night. And I think we shall have
to put in one big day’s walk, perhaps more than
that. I should first like to know where the boys
are. Jane, will you make an effort to locate
them to-morrow?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, indeed, Miss Elting.”
</p>
<p>
“When we have definite information on that
point we ought to be able to map out a plan of
campaign that will win the contest for us. I
believe we have gotten ahead of them now and
that we shall be able to keep our lead.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course we are going to win,” reiterated
Harriet Burrell.
</p>
<p>
“If it is all settled that we are to win the race,
I propose that we celebrate to-night,” suggested
Jane.
</p>
<p>
“How?” asked Margery.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233'></a>233</span>
</p>
<p>
“I’ve got a bag of fruit in the car. We’ll
make fruit lemonade, then we’ll have a combietta
concert.”
</p>
<p>
“What ith a combietta conthert?” interrupted
Tommy curiously.
</p>
<p>
“Wait and see,” teased Jane.
</p>
<p>
“Now, Jane, be good and tell us about this
combietta affair?” coaxed Hazel. “What is
it?”
</p>
<p>
“An instrumental concert,” giggled Jane.
“I got the musical instruments when I was in
town doing some shopping. Oh, don’t worry,
darlin’s. You all know to play them. The
first thing to do is to decide upon the tune.
How about the ‘Marching Through Georgia’
for a starter?”
</p>
<p>
Jane spread out six squares of thin white
paper. She then produced the same number of
small packages.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, we’ll wake the squirrels and the chipmunks
and the weasles,” promised Jane, with
a grin of anticipation.
</p>
<p>
Tommy picked at the wrapping on the end
of one of the small packages and uttered an exclamation
of disappointment.
</p>
<p>
“It ithn’t a musical inthrument at all,” she
declared indignantly. “It ith nothing but a common
old black comb.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s just where you’re wrong,” answered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234'></a>234</span>
Jane. “These combs are new. I bought them
in the village store this very day. Listen,
dears. This is the combietta. It makes music
through its teeth, and plays any tune you call
for.”
</p>
<p>
“Wonderful,” laughed Miss Elting. “There
is something very familiar about this marvelous
musical instrument. Combietta, do you call it,
Jane?”
</p>
<p>
“Sure I do. But the name is my own invention.
The music is as old as the combs themselves
and I don’t know how old they are.”
</p>
<p>
“I remember having made music with combs
when I was a girl in short frocks,” nodded the
guardian. “Play, Jane, and show the girls how
to make music.”
</p>
<p>
Crazy Jane folded one of the square slips of
paper over the teeth of one of the combs, then
placed the comb’s teeth between her own.
</p>
<p>
“Zu—zu—zu-zee-zee-zah,” she breathed
through paper and comb, which strange sounds
were instantly interpreted by Jane’s companions,
as “Come Back to Erin.”
</p>
<p>
Each girl with a cry of delight, now snatched
up a comb, wrapped it in the thin paper and
joined enthusiastically in the chorus of “Come
Back to Erin.” Tommy Thompson, fully as
delighted as her companions, leaned against a
tree making hideous noises on her comb; Miss
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235'></a>235</span>
Elting, sitting on a stump, eyes fixed on the
foliage far above her, was an enthusiastic
performer in the combietta concert.
</p>
<p>
“Now, ‘Marching Through Georgia,’” she
cried.
</p>
<p>
“I can’t play fast enough to play that,” complained
Buster.
</p>
<p>
“Then play anything you like,” answered
Harriet, with a merry laugh.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. Make a noise. You don’t all have to
play the same tune. This is a celebration,”
shouted Jane. “What we want is noise and lots
of it to celebrate the victory we are going to
win.”
</p>
<p>
And noise there was, a perfect pandemonium
of sounds, principally inharmonious.
</p>
<p>
A sudden, startling chorus of yells and a
burst of music from the forest, brought the
girls’ concert to a sudden stop. Lights flashed
from the bushes near at hand, whirling about
them in giddy circles like great pinwheels. The
Meadow-Brook Girls were surrounded by wildly
yelling figures, strange flaring lights—and
music.
</p>
<p>
“Indianth!” screamed Tommy. “We’ll all
be thcalped. Oh, thave me!” Then the little
lisping girl ran like a frightened deer, for the
protection of the Meadow-Brook Girls’ tent.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236'></a>236</span><a name='chXXIII' id='chXXIII'></a>CHAPTER XXIII—THE HARMONICA SERENADE</h2>
<p>
“Oh, what is it?” wailed Margery.
</p>
<p>
No one was able to answer the question
for the moment. It was a startling
interruption. Even Harriet, though unafraid,
could not make up her mind what was
the meaning of the outbreak.
</p>
<p>
Now she saw what the lights were. They
were flaring torches made from cat-tails. Then
all at once she recalled that the Tramp Club
boys played harmonicas. She had heard them
play once before.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t be afraid, girls. It is the boys,” said
Harriet in a relieved tone.
</p>
<p>
“The boys?” questioned Miss Elting. Then
her face lighted up understandingly. “Oh the
rascals!” she exclaimed.
</p>
<p>
The girls now that they knew no danger
threatened them stood perfectly still, waiting
for the concert to come to an end.
</p>
<p>
“You may come in, boys, when you have finished
your concert,” called the guardian. “We
have enjoyed the serenade very much.”
</p>
<p>
The music and shouting ceased abruptly. A
moment later Captain Baker stepped into the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237'></a>237</span>
camp. His face was flushed, but there was a
certain sheepishness about him that made Harriet
Burrell’s eyes twinkle.
</p>
<p>
“Why, Captain! We did not look for you
this evening,” greeted Miss Elting.
</p>
<p>
“Thought you had given us the slip, did
you?” grinned George. “You’ll have to get up
earlier in the morning, to do that.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, won’t you though!” chorused his companions
trooping in after their captain.
</p>
<p>
“But how did you find us?” questioned Harriet.
</p>
<p>
“Easiest thing in the world. We followed
Miss McCarthy’s car tracks.”
</p>
<p>
“Where to?” twinkled Jane.
</p>
<p>
“All over the country. You surely led us a
fine chase. But we found you, just the same.”
</p>
<p>
Tommy now ventured from the tent.
</p>
<p>
“Thay, you nearly thcared me to death,” she
chided. “What do you boyth want?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, Tommy, they came to serenade us,”
reproved Miss Elting. “We enjoyed the music
very much,” she said, turning toward the boys.
“If you will sit down and play another selection,
we will serve refreshments afterwards. Jane!
Will you get the things ready?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. But the boys don’t deserve it. However,
so long as we are going to win the race
we can afford to treat them well,” teased Jane.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238'></a>238</span>
</p>
<p>
The captain smiled a superior smile.
</p>
<p>
“We could have gone right on to the end of
the route to-day without stopping, if we had
wished to do so. But we didn’t want to take
an unfair advantage of you.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no. You boys never do take an unfair
advantage, do you?” chuckled Crazy Jane.
Miss Elting gave her a warning glance. The
captain did not observe it.
</p>
<p>
“Give them another tune, boys,” George ordered.
</p>
<p>
“First please extinguish those cat-tail
torches,” requested Harriet. “You will set the
woods on fire, if you are not careful. Everything
is so dry now that a fire would start very
easily.”
</p>
<p>
The torches were ground out under foot, after
which the Tramp Club played “Home Sweet
Home” on the harmonicas. At a nod from the
guardian the girls got out their combs and
joined in the tune. The woodland inhabitants
probably never had heard a concert like this.
It sent the birds hopping from limb to limb in
great alarm. Fortunately there were no neighbors
near at hand, so only the inhabitants of the
forest were disturbed.
</p>
<p>
Jane that day had purchased a large chocolate
cake at a baker shop in the village. She
brought this out then disappeared into the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239'></a>239</span>
tent, emerging a few minutes later with a pail
of fruit lemonade, while Hazel, who had accompanied
Jane, followed her, bearing cups and
glasses. Miss Elting busied herself with cutting
the cake and Harriet served the lemonade.
</p>
<p>
“Well, boys, here’s to the candy we’re going
to have when we get to our journey’s end,”
teased Jane McCarthy, raising her glass of
lemonade.
</p>
<p>
“And here,” returned the captain, raising his
glass with a flourish, “is to those beautiful
handkerchiefs that we’re going to wear next to
our hearts for years and years to come.”
</p>
<p>
“To the stars that hold our future,” teased
Harriet.
</p>
<p>
The captain paused with the glass of lemonade
in his hand. He glanced quickly at Harriet
Burrell, but the innocent expression on her face
told him nothing. Miss Elting saw that George
had something on his mind. She suspected
what it was. An amused smile played about
the corners of the guardian’s mouth. There
was a smile in Harriet’s eyes, too, as she caught
and read the thought in the mind of Miss Elting.
</p>
<p>
After the cake and lemonade had been disposed
of, the party of young people chatted for
the better part of an hour. Captain Baker,
however, appeared uneasy. Twice he essayed
to speak then checked himself abruptly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240'></a>240</span>
</p>
<p>
“It’s coming now,” whispered Harriet.
“He’s trying to think of a way to begin.”
</p>
<p>
Miss Elting nodded.
</p>
<p>
“I have a confession to make,” began the
captain, in an embarrassed manner.
</p>
<p>
“A confession!” exclaimed Harriet in a surprised
tone.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I have. Oh, it isn’t for myself alone,
but for my friends as well,” continued the captain
doggedly. The other boys exhibited signs
of uneasiness.
</p>
<p>
“What about, Mr. Baker?” asked the guardian
sweetly.
</p>
<p>
“It is about those melons.”
</p>
<p>
“But, my dear boy, you need not apologize
for them. They were simply delicious. I can’t
tell you how much we enjoyed them.” Miss
Elting was making it as hard for George as
possible.
</p>
<p>
“It—it isn’t that. Oh, what’s the use? I
don’t know how to say it. We hadn’t any right
to give you those melons, Miss Elting.”
</p>
<p>
“No right? Please explain yourself, Mr.
Baker.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll tell you all about it. We took those melons
from the farmer’s field without leave. We
didn’t mean to play a mean trick on you, but we
did. We didn’t think the farmer would accuse
you girls of stealing the melons. We’re awfully sorry
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241'></a>241</span>
he made such a fuss about it and
that you had to pay for them. Will you please
let us return to you the money that you paid
him. It was our treat, you know.”
</p>
<p>
“Hm-m-m! This is a serious matter,” replied
the guardian slowly. The girls sat with
lowered heads so that the boys might not discover
the laughter in their eyes. “I cannot accept
the money for the melons. We had better
consider the incident closed. It is very manly
of you, however, to come and tell us about it.
But what induced you to do so?”
</p>
<p>
“I gueth hith conthcience troubled him,” suggested
Tommy wisely.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I think so. But there was something
else,” admitted the boy. “It wasn’t wholly
conscience. We didn’t realize how very wrong
it was until——”
</p>
<p>
“Until the Oracle told you,” nodded Tommy.
</p>
<p>
“What!” exclaimed George. The eyes of the
Tramp Club were fixed on Tommy. “What do
you mean by that?”
</p>
<p>
Harriet got up and with crossed hands before
her, chin lowered, eyelids half veiling her eyes,
moved demurely toward the captain.
</p>
<p>
“Cross my palm with silver and the past and
future shall be revealed to you,” she mumbled.
</p>
<p>
George Baker gazed at her, with suspicious,
puzzled eyes. All at once he sprang up.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242'></a>242</span>
</p>
<p>
“I know you now! I knew I had seen you before,
but I couldn’t place you. You were the
Star of the East!”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” admitted Harriet.
</p>
<p>
“And thhe told your fortune,” chuckled
Tommy.
</p>
<p>
Margery and Hazel giggled. Crazy Jane exclaimed
derisively:
</p>
<p>
“Oh, boys, boys! That’s the time you got your
desserts! We paid you back with interest!”
</p>
<p>
“It was a mean trick,” flared George. “We
never would have thought it of you. It was the
meanest trick I ever heard of. I’m sorry I
made a fool of myself by coming here and
apologizing to you.”
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Baker, don’t lose your temper,” begged
Miss Elting, scarcely able to control her voice
for laughter. “We have evened our score so
let’s shake hands and be friends.”
</p>
<p>
“No, thank you. I’m sorry to refuse, but you
have made fools of us,” retorted George angrily.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no. That ith not pothible,” piped
Tommy.
</p>
<p>
“Come on, fellows. We will get out of here
before they make us angry,” urged Captain
Baker, snatching up his hat and starting away.
</p>
<p>
“Please wait,” begged Miss Elting.
</p>
<p>
George shook his head.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243'></a>243</span>
</p>
<p>
“What about our compact?” called Harriet.
</p>
<p>
“We’re going on and win the race. We’ll
show you that you aren’t such athletes as you
think. At least you shan’t make fools of us
at that. Good night.”
</p>
<p>
Captain Baker and his friends strode angrily
from the camp. They did not so much as look
back. Perhaps the boys were really not so angry
as they pretended to be.
</p>
<p>
“It’s too bad. I didn’t think they would
take it that way,” cried Harriet. “I surely
thought they would be able to take a joke. Well,
what’s done can’t be undone. There’s nothing
more to be done except to go on and try to win
the race.”
</p>
<p>
Jane had disappeared. Where she had gone
the girls did not know. It was some time before
she returned and when she did she was
excited. Her hair was awry and her face
flushed.
</p>
<p>
“Jane, where have you been?” demanded the
guardian.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve been scouting. Girls, those miserable
boys are planning to play another trick on you.
They’re going to start to-night and go on without
stopping until they get home. What shall
we do?”
</p>
<p>
The girls gazed solemnly into each other’s
eyes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244'></a>244</span>
</p>
<p>
“That seems to settle it,” spoke up Margery
finally. “Well, let them have the race. Who
cares?”
</p>
<p>
“We all care,” answered Harriet, springing
to her feet. “We simply must win that race
now. Everybody will laugh at us if we don’t,
and I just couldn’t stand it to see those boys
grinning triumphantly at us afterwards. I don’t
care so much about the others.”
</p>
<p>
“What would you suggest, Harriet?” inquired
Miss Elting.
</p>
<p>
“Suggest? Why, there is only one thing to
suggest. Checkmate them at their own game.
We’ll start for Meadow-Brook this very night
and we’ll keep going until we get there. Are
you with me, girls?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes!” shouted the girls.
</p>
<h2><a name='chXXIV' id='chXXIV'></a>CHAPTER XXIV—CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>
“Not quite so fast, girls,” warned Miss
Elting.
</p>
<p>
They turned toward her questioningly.
Their eyes were sparkling, their faces
flushed.
</p>
<p>
“What would you suggest, Miss Elting?”
asked Harriet.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245'></a>245</span>
</p>
<p>
“Remember, that, if we take the route suggested
by the Gipsy, we shall have to travel
some of the roughest country in the state. Are
you equal to the hike?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes!”
</p>
<p>
“We shall have to walk all night and a good
part of the day to-morrow, and even then the
boys may win the contest. Are you willing to
try it?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes!”
</p>
<p>
“Then we will make our plans and get
started. According to my calculations, it will
be a twenty mile hike to Meadow-Brook by the
way we propose to go. The boys will have a
good ten miles further to travel if they go by
way of the road. But having better going they
will naturally travel much faster than we. Listen!
We must travel light, with nothing in our
packs except just sufficient food to carry us
through. Jane, you will have to spend the night
at the nearest farm house and come back for
the tent and supplies in the morning. I hardly
believe any one will disturb them over night.
You must go at once or the people of the house
will have retired. Go quietly.”
</p>
<p>
Ten minutes later Jane was on her way to
the farm house in her car, undetected by the
members of the Tramp Club.
</p>
<p>
“Now we will get ready at once. Let us be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246'></a>246</span>
certain that none of the boys are watching. I
would suggest that you girls lie down for an
hour or so, while Harriet and myself get the
packs together.”
</p>
<p>
Hazel obediently led the way into the tent,
Margery and Tommy following.
</p>
<p>
“I can’t thleep. I’m too exthited,” protested
Tommy. She and her companions did sleep
however. They were allowed to rest for two
hours. When they awakened Harriet informed
them that the Tramp Club already had started.
Half an hour later the girls themselves had
taken the trail to Meadow-Brook.
</p>
<p>
The Pathfinders made straight for a blue
range of mountains that stood out dark and forbidding
in the bright moonlight. The girls were
full of enthusiasm, and would have walked
much faster had not their guardian insisted on
their saving their strength for the more difficult
traveling after they reached the hills.
</p>
<p>
It was three o’clock in the morning when
finally they dropped down a sharp incline into
the gloomy depths of a rocky canyon. A trickling
stream flowed through the canyon and the
walls stood high on either side, rising sheer for
a hundred feet.
</p>
<p>
“You will have to wade, girls. But I think
we are all sufficiently hardened so that we shall
not suffer more than temporary discomfort
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247'></a>247</span>
from getting our feet wet,” said the guardian,
with an encouraging smile.
</p>
<p>
The girls plunged into the brook without
hesitation. The water was only ankle deep, but
the stones on the bottom of the creek were moss-covered
and slippery. Still, they made good
progress, really traveling faster than before
they had entered the canyon.
</p>
<p>
At daylight Miss Elting called a halt. She
had chosen a place where a dry shelf of rock
offered a resting place. The girls threw themselves
down flat on their backs. There was no
wood with which to build a fire, but Miss Elting
produced a small alcohol stove from her pack
and made coffee. This with biscuits they had
brought proved very refreshing. The guardian
did not permit them to remain on the shelf of
rock for a long time, fearing that their muscles
might become stiffened. Then the journey was
taken up again. So full of enthusiasm and determination
were the Meadow-Brook Girls that
not one of them offered a word of complaint;
but when at two o’clock that afternoon, they
emerged from the canyon into the open country,
Tommy and Margery were limping a little.
</p>
<p>
Beyond in the haze of a distant valley lay
Meadow-Brook. The girls eager to get to their
journey’s end pushed on again. After half an
hour’s walking, Miss Elting called a halt. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248'></a>248</span>
shaded her eyes and gazed off to the west. A
thin brown line was crawling slowly along the
road.
</p>
<p>
“It’s the boys!” cried Harriet.
</p>
<p>
“They’re going to win,” groaned Margery.
</p>
<p>
“They are not. We must run for it.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” agreed Miss Elting. “But don’t get
excited. Keep your lips tightly closed. Breathe
through your nostrils and keep your shoulders
well back. Don’t keep yourselves rigid, but
just trudge along with every muscle relaxed.
They don’t see us. Ready! Go!”
</p>
<p>
The girls crossed the field at a trot. It was
a good two miles to the village. They ran
slowly, but steadily. At the end of a mile the
guardian again ordered a halt, directing the
girls to lie down in the field flat on their backs.
A few moments later they were up and off again.
They saw the boys a long distance to the rear,
still trudging doggedly along. And half an
hour later the girls stepped from the field out
into the road. They heard the chug of a motor
car. It swept on and overtook them. It was
Jane. She was howling like a wild Indian.
</p>
<p>
“They’re coming! They’re coming. Run for
it!” she yelled.
</p>
<p>
By this time the boys had discovered the
girls. They, too, began to run. The race was
on in earnest. Never had those girls run and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249'></a>249</span>
stumbled and lurched along as they did that
afternoon. The boys gained slowly. The girls
were nearing home. Jane was leading the procession,
standing up in her car, steering as she
stood, setting the pace for the Meadow-Brook
Girls. She was shouting and yelling to keep up
their courage, but it was an almost killing pace
that she was making for them.
</p>
<p>
The girls staggered over the line that marked
the village limits.
</p>
<p>
“Home!” cried Miss Elting.
</p>
<p>
“We’ve won!” screamed Jane almost beside
herself with joy.
</p>
<p>
The girls walked unsteadily to one side of
the road and sat down gasping. They had won
the race, but by a slender margin. The boys
were still forging ahead, running at top speed.
They had thrown away their packs and were
racing into the village in light order. Five minutes
later a crowd of weary, humiliated boys
came hurrying up to where the girls sat. They
were much more fatigued than were their opponents,
besides which, they were chagrined beyond
words.
</p>
<p>
“Did we win?” jeered Jane triumphantly.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. You won,” admitted Captain Baker
sourly. “I take off my hat to you.” He suited
the action to the word. “You beat us at our
own game. I don’t know how you did it, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250'></a>250</span>
you did and that’s all there is about it, and we
aren’t going to whine. We’ll take our medicine.
We’re going to stay in town the rest of the day,
and we’ll see you later on. Good-bye until
to-night.”
</p>
<p>
The girls’ weariness left them almost magically.
They hopped into Jane’s car and were
swiftly whirled home. Later in the afternoon
a box of marshmallows for each of the girls was
delivered to Miss Elting. But the fun was not
yet ended.
</p>
<p>
That night the Tramp Club and the Meadow-Brook
Girls were the guests of Tommy Thompson’s
father and mother at dinner. Tommy’s
parents, as well as the parents of the other
girls, were delighted with the splendid physical
condition of their daughters. Before each
girl’s plate at the table that stretched the length
of the big dining room, was a box of marshmallows,
before each boy’s plate a handkerchief.
</p>
<p>
The marshmallow boxes were tied with pink
ribbon, the color chosen by the Meadow-Brook
Girls for their organization.
</p>
<p>
“On Hallowe’en,” declared Dill Dodd
solemnly, “you shall hear from the tramps
again, and the message will have a bearing on
the question of melons.”
</p>
<p>
Nor did Baker’s Tramp Club forget. Surely
enough, on Hallowe’en
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251'></a>251</span>
Harriet received for herself and her friends two great, ripe, luscious
watermelons with a most cordially worded note
from the boys.
</p>
<p>
“We must see to it that the Tramp Club
never do anything like this again,” said Miss
Elting, as she and the Meadow-Brook Girls cut
up and enjoyed the watermelons. “At this season
of the year fruit of this kind comes only
from hot houses and is very expensive. The
boys, to show their contrition, have mortgaged
their pocket money, I fear.”
</p>
<p>
Soon after their return the Meadow-Brook
Girls entered upon the duties and pleasures
of the new school year. We may be assured
also that at the proper time, Miss Elting would
see to it that the beads which the girls had won
by their deeds of daring and other achievements
during their recent trip, would be
awarded. But we shall hear from them again.
</p>
<p>
They had ahead of them many happy days of
outdoor life and adventure, as will be learned
in the next volume of this series, which is published
under the title, “<span class='sc'>The Meadow-Brook
Girls Afloat</span>; Or, The Stormy Cruise of the

Really good and new stories for boys and girls are not
plentiful. Many stories, too, are so highly improbable as
to bring a grin of derision to the young reader’s face before
he has gone far. The name of ALTEMUS is a distinctive
brand on the cover of a book, always ensuring
the buyer of having a book that is up-to-date and fine
throughout. No buyer of an ALTEMUS book is ever
disappointed.
</p>
<p>
Many are the claims made as to the inexpensiveness
of books. Go into any bookstore and ask for an Altemus
book. Compare the price charged you for Altemus
books with the price demanded for other juvenile books.
You will at once discover that a given outlay of money
will buy more of the ALTEMUS books than of those
published by other houses.

a great educational value for all young readers.

“Give us more Dick Prescott books!”
</p>
<p>
This has been the burden of the cry from young readers of the
country over. Almost numberless letters have been received by the
publishers, making this eager demand; for Dick Prescott, Dave Darrin,
Tom Reade, and the other members of Dick &amp; Co. are the most
popular high school boys in the land. Boys will alternately thrill
and chuckle when reading these splendid narratives.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
